							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 08-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">This morning was the easiest move we've done yet. We woke up and dragged our bags not even 100m, it's a good job too because Alex is really sick.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">He was fine last night but since waking up he hasn't stopped throwing up. Last thing he ate was all the jackfruit yesterday so he's just throwing up the water he drinks and then dry heaving, it sounds awful. I don’t know how to help and I feel really useless.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Spent 2 hours on the phone to my mum panicking whilst Alex lay on the bed like a wet blanket, eventually got him to take paracetamol and then a dioralyte which has perked him up a little now but God it’s been a long day.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="54">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 07-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We have actual clean clothes! Our host Chanti let us use an industrial sized washing machine free of charge. We filled the machine up and added powder and softener but couldn't get the machine to fill with water. We sent her a message and left for the day and when we came back she'd washed and hung it all to dry for us! We felt awful, especially after loading it up with literally all of our clothes. We needed to use a key to unlock the water tap apparently. We made sure to thank her but it still felt like too much.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">In town I read the front page of the China Daily. Very interesting, I read about China's commendable efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict by providing a win-win proposal for both nations, denying the 'Western propaganda about the so-called preferential treatment of China towards Russia'. I'd love an excuse to analyse the different literary devices used.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Chinese Paper.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">In the cafe I lost the battle for Alex's attention to a couple of rubik's cubes, or rather one rubik’s cube and one megaminx. Needless to say the self appointed puzzle master solved them both easily.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Alex Cubing.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We walked around and looked in some antique and craft shops again and then met Chanti and Yoxa (our other host) back at the airbnb so they could show us around 2 other rooms as we had wanted to extend our stay but they didn't have availability. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I think we'll stay in the tree house next door, the bottom floor is completely open and the upstairs has a balcony around the front and a tree growing through the middle. It's lovely. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Chanti let us pick mulberries from her tree and gave us some sliced mango with a sachet of spice that we naturally tried and hated. She also gave Alex some more of the mystery fruit he accepted from her the previous night. Took a while to figure out what it was but we've concluded it's jackfruit. I think it tastes unnaturally sweet and the smell is quite sickly but Alex ate it all.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We rode our bikes to the night market. I bought a sarong and crocket top, Alex did some tentative bartering to get the price down. We had a bowl of noodles and afterwards whilst I enjoyed some mini coconut pancakes Alex bought even more jackfruit.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Erin Coconut.jpg" alt="meh">
						</div>
						
						<div id="53">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 06-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We woke up and went out on the bicycles. Mine doesn't have working breaks and Alex's can't change gear so his legs are spinning around like billy-o whilst moving at a slow walking pace. We still had a great time and the ride into the 'city centre' only took 15 minutes. The 'city' is the size and atmosphere of a quaint town and the French influence is balanced really nicely. The roads aren't super busy like nearly everywhere else we've been so riding our bikes around is relaxing even if we have to remember to ride on the other side.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to a cafe overlooking the Mekong and then paid the small toll to walk across the bamboo bridge. The bridge has to be rebuilt every year after wet season because the water rises too high and washes it away. It was surprisingly bouncy.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Erin View Cafe.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The other side of the bridge is considered the countryside and has some really impressive workshops and stores. We met one lady who was working on a huge wooden loom and sold gorgeous woven fabrics and silk. I bought a scarf that I'm obsessed with but absolutely terrified to wear in case it gets ruined. She packaged it for me in handmade paper with pressed flowers. We also went into one shop and were shown a painting that had been done using sand.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Bamboo Bridge.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Scarf.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Back in town we of course had to try Laos Beer which we both really enjoyed, probably not a coincidence though that Alex enjoys the cheapest beer on the menu.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Erin Beer.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we finished the day off by volunteering at a bookshop that invites English speaking foreigners inside to have conversations with Laos teens that are learning English so that they can practice their speaking skills. It was really interesting. I spoke to Maoui who is the same age as me and also likes the colour yellow. She complimented my nose and thought I looked really young. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">She told me about her friends and family, and asked how I collect memories so I told her about the website and showed her my bracelet that has recently acquired the bead for Laos. We had a really good chat because her English was almost fluent and we could relate to each other even if our experiences were so different. I don't think I've taken enough time during our travels to truly think and appreciate how privileged I am. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Meanwhile Alex had a chat with a younger boy and had street view up on Google to show him his house. I think their conversations were more limited but the boy was really interested in finding out about Alex's life.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="52">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="luang-prabang"> 05-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">The flight to Laos by far had to be the easiest airport experience me or Alex have ever had. There was nobody at the check-in desk but the staff and barely a line for security. Once in the airport, we waddled over to the gate and pretty much boarded immediately. The plane was the size of a bus which terrified me and thrilled Alex. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Lao Plane.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex got us to have a good look around at all of the jumbo jets before we left because it’ll ‘be a while until we see any again’. I tried my best to feign enthusiasm. Lao Airlines, pulling out all of the stops, can you believe on a 2 hour flight we were served food. A modest sandwich and super sweet yoghurt but appreciated nonetheless. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Getting to the Airbnb was easy, just got a taxi where Alex sat upfront giving the driver directions. First impressions look good, our host had left some rice cakes, sweet biscuit lattice and some really nice sweet-pea tea.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Luang Airbnb.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Luang Treats.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Can’t comment too much on the neighbourhood, we fell asleep almost immediately on arrival for the remainder of the day only waking up after sunset where we tried in vain to find somewhere to eat and said Sawaidee (hello) back to every single person we passed in the street. As a result, we do not get the impression that Luang Prabang is particularly touristy. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Side note: we drew out 2,500,000 Kip which came out in a massive wad of 25 individual 100,000 notes which felt insane but was only £125. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Even less interesting side note: while in Thailand it seems the pound increased in value significantly over Thai Baht as when previously £300 got us 11,200, it most recently got us 12,300.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="51">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 04-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">As planned, I spent the day mostly doing work..vastly underestimated how long it would take me. But I had Alex beside me to help motivate and distract. Here’s the view from the cafe, felt really appreciative of my life and the opportunities that have come my way.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Cafe View.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex was supposed to work on the website and implement some changes, however he mostly spent the time teaching himself online chess (which he’s still really bad at).</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Alex Cafe.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Overall, the day passed quickly with not too much to say aside from some really good crispy pork with unlimited soup for dinner.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="50">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 03-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We moved hostel <i>again</i>, however this time it feels very worth it. We’re in the suburbs staying in a beautifully maintained old house that’s attached to a modern and bright cafe. The french windows at the end of the bed overlook the garden and fill the room with natural sunlight, and we were offered a free drink from the cafe when we arrived. It’s lovely, I'm actually excited to wake up early tomorrow and find myself a cosy little spot downstairs to do my work. I’ve been really fortunate to be offered some freelance work from my previous job, and here feels like the perfect place to do it. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It’s a shame we can’t stay longer but if it wasn't already apparent we stayed in Koh Tao far longer than we initially planned, with the 45 days visa running out soon we won’t have time to visit northern Thailand which means our next stop after here is Laos! Alex is extra excited because we chose to save ourselves 2 x 10hr bus journeys and fly straight from Bangkok to Luang Prabang. We’ll be in a Lao Airlines ATR 42/72, I’ve been shown a picture already, it looks… like a plane. Apparently it's most likely going to be the first propeller plane I’ll have flown on, which is fun? The flight’s only 2hrs so I won't be complaining anyway. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We found somewhere close by to get our visa photos taken and I won't pretend to be modest, I think the photos came out incredibly well! I think some photoshopping might have occurred on the sly because no visa or passport picture is ever supposed to come out looking that good. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Passport Picture.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to a restaurant whilst we waited for the photos to develop. Super cute place where we got Thai tea, ice coffee and ‘volcano roti’ which was a surprise. I’m not sure what we expected volcano to taste like but spicy condensed milk wasn't it. We went back to the same place for dinner and had a really good meal.                   </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 02-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">The heat is unbearable and after waking up and taking our first anti-malarial tablet we both felt really nauseous. It’s really difficult to find the motivation to go out and explore the city, getting around is difficult since the buses are unreliable, there’s a huge area not covered by trains and taxis are only cheap if you opt for a passenger seat on a scooter, which Alex doesn’t feel comfortable with. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Unsurprisingly then it was food that motivated us to get out of bed, we met Bart outside of Thipsamai for what was supposedly the best and oldest pad thai in Thailand, with a history of serving the dish going back to 1939. It was underwhelming, and we both agree the pad thai in Krabi is by far still the best we’ve had. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Bad Thai.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Cocktail.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Back at our hostel the lady at the desk told us about a festival being held at the temple around the corner that we should check out. We went and had a really nice time. We found Thai tea ice cream to try, and Alex won me two prizes on the shooting game. I also had a few goes but was less successful. I’ve already attached the strange mice to our bags, but the nose has fallen off mine already!</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Gun Fair.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Ice Lollies.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">In the evening we met back up with Bart to visit the stunning rooftop bar at Vertigo. We drank pina coladas and spoke freely overlooking the city scape that was lit up in the night. It was a really nice night, Bart was too kind and paid for all of the drinks and only let us repay him with a bowl of cheap noodles at the end of the night. We almost got pulled in for a ping-pong show several times where I fear Alex would have been eaten alive. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 01-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We painfully moved hostels in the morning to a cheaper and supposedly better located one. It took us 3 hours! All because the bus kicked everyone off mid journey, so we then had to walk to another bus stop to wait for a different bus. We stood waiting in 37 degrees heat with our backpacks plastered to us, dripping with sweat. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After already waiting a while, a little old man became friendly with us so we sat speaking to him for over an hour whilst we waited. His English wasn’t perfect but we muddled through a few conversations. He told us he had spent a lot of time working in New York, and showed us his New Jersey driving license. He helped us get the right bus, which coincidentally was the same one he was waiting for, and he bought us ice cream! It was so sweet, I sat next to him on the bus and caught him listening to Taylor Swift ‘Love Story’ such a softie. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Charlie Bustop.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">After eventually checking in and ahem changing t shirts…</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Sweaty.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We passed through the Khao San Road again to grab cheap quick food. It was already starting to get busy even in the daylight. A man tried to hassle Alex into having a suit made and used the very original line ‘Long hair, long life, happy happy wife’. I flashed him a big smile.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We nearly got run over by 1,000 scooters as we were crossing 5 lanes of traffic. The <i>helpful</i>walking green man light at the crossing decided to abandon us mid way and the bikes didn’t wait a second longer. I think if I'd have been on my own I would have froze but Alex dragged us across. A precursor to Vietnam I suppose.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We accidentally stumbled into a peaceful protest whilst waiting for our taxi to meet Bart at the cinema. Large banners read ‘Thailand is not beautiful’ and ‘Free all political prisoners’. In the taxi we drove past the riot police getting ready. It’s worth reading about the situation if you’re interested but I won’t go into any details.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Bart had two delicious pieces of chicken waiting for us, and he’d already got our tickets. We watched ‘The Whale’. It was shown in English with Thai subtitles. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend the film, it wasn’t an enjoyable watch, however the salted popcorn and air conditioned room made it comfortable. Before the film came on there was a 5 minute slideshow in homage to the King where you would expect film trailers. It certainly made an impression on us, I’m just not sure it was the one they intended. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I was really excited when I saw red bean taiyaki being sold in the food court. I bought one and finally got to pretend just for a few bites that I was in an anime, however I didn’t actually enjoy the bean texture with such a sweet taste, so naturally Alex gobbled it up for me. That was it for the day, we said goodbye to Bart again and we walked home, stopping by China town for some average noodles.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We are bad travelers and once again slept in until late morning. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got food at Bamee kon sae Lee (thong lo) which was a small portion, a seemingly common trend here, but the crispy pork was incredible. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went out in search of a camera shop that stocked the dive case we need for our 360 camera but spoiler alert: we walked 26,000 steps, visited two colossal shopping malls, and didn't buy ANYTHING! We didn't even leave Sukhumvit Road! All day walking down One. Single. Road. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Maybe I should have treated myself to one of the *expensive* wet suits in Billabong to soften the blow. </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Coupley Park.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We did visit two parks which were nice. Went to Benchakitti Park at golden hour and walked along a pedestrian bridge overlooking the unglamorous residential area of Bangkok whilst skyscapers crowded the sky. I think the juxtaposition speaks for itself.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Slum.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Green Walkway.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we wandered into Lumphini Park and saw this beastly creature joining in on a park run. Nobody else seemed even a little bit phased and he crossed the path in no rush minding his own business. What in the world even is it!?</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Big Lizard.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Bangkok Sunset.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Dinner was disappointing, we found a modest looking restaurant that boasted Michelin recognition and the 'best chicken rice'. It was a half portion of plain rice with plain chicken. I read Google reviews afterwards and everyone was raving about how good it was! Am I being gaslighted or are we actually wrong in thinking it was tasteless?</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Anyhow mango sticky rice and thai tea cheered us up and gave us the much needed energy to get back. It’s been a really, really long day.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex has taken to singing in the evening, or sometimes just making random noises. I don't know how to politely get him to shut up, so I'm writing it here in the hopes he'll take the hint ;)</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="feb-week4"> 27-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We slept in really late this morning. In our defense there are no windows in our room so we woke up at 11.30am still in pitch darkness.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We did some housekeeping i.e writing updates, planning where we go next, checking the budget... all the boring adult things we completely neglected to do whilst gallivanting around Koh Tao without a second thought for anything.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex read online that if you visit the ancient city after 4pm then the tickets are half price, which turned out to not be the case however we weren't mad because the park was empty and golden hour was serving. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Erin Bike.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We rented bicycles and rode around freely without checking the map. It was fun to have a sense of urgency and speed around in the limited daylight getting pictures and videos of each other. There was so much to see. All of the temples, statues and monuments are scaled down replicas, and we absolutely did not read any of the information boards explaining the significance of the real buildings.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Golden Temple.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Dome Temple.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We might not have learnt anything but we had a brilliant time. It felt like we had gone out on a date and so we acted unbearably coupley and got gorgeous videos in the process. I hope Alex eventually finds a way for us to upload videos to the website.</p>
							<img class="lone-image-" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Alex Arch.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Dinner was a hard find, so much choice we spent ages deciding but eventually settled on Japanese food at Inari. I had yaki soba which reminded me of the hokkien noodles in phuket. Very delicious. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Morning ferry to catch, very sad to be leaving the island life behind, especially for a 10 hour journey to Bangkok. I made a big mistake eating raw onion at breakfast, it was all I could taste for hours, even after we did get banana roti at a service stop.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were finally spat out straight onto Khaosan Road at 9pm, which was very overwhelming coming from a dark, quiet bus. The street was bustling with party goers, shops, food vendors, clubs, an entire crocodile on a spit. We opted for a safe Pad Thai then had an absolute mission ahead of ourselves in trying to find the hostel. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got a public bus but weren't able to successfully communicate where we needed to get off because we were getting a change, then the bus became jam packed and we were both forced to suspend ourselves over the end of our seats because our backpacks took up too much space. We were eventually told to get off as the ticket lady enthusiastically mimed we were here, as did the driver, telling us to just walk across the bridge. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were in fact not there, nor anywhere. We struggled to catch a taxi but at 11:40pm we did eventually find someone to take us and made It to our hostel/ cat cafe at 12. Thank god for late check ins.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our room is a bunk BUT there is a bean bag couch!</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="44">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 25-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Didn't get much sleep, there was a bunch of English loud mouths at the other end of the hostel that came back late. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were waiting at DJL at 6am feeling very bleary eyed. The shop wasn't even open so we couldn't fill up our water bottle with the ice cold water they have. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were on a commercial ferry instead of their own boat because it was busy, the unfamiliarity made me uneasy, and then we saw an actual Tornado!...maybe more like a baby twister, but either way it was all looking like a bad omen.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Tornado.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">There were other diving schools and professionals on the boat, everybody was swanning about in their aesthetic wetsuits and nice kit, meanwhile me and Alex were struggling to pull on the soaking wet and cold wet suits from the day before. I felt really bitter.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">1st dive was to Chumphon for our deep dive. We went down to 30.9 meters and our instructor pulled out a colour chart so we could see how red and orange become murky and brown, he also had on him a first aid mask so we could see how compressed the air inside became.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We saw a huge moody looking grouper! We slowly swam all the way around him and he didn't move once, just watched up in disdain. Here's a doodle I drew for reference.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Grouper.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We also saw the biggest school of fish yet, we think they were either snapper or smooth tailed trevally. There were thousands, and they were all contained in an invisible barrier that we were at the edge of, so when we looked up it was like looking up at an infinite wall of fish. It was like something out of a Sci Fi. I wish I could explain it better or be able to video it. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">There were swarms of tiny black fish hovering down the coral cliff face, they reminded me so much of flies it freaked me out, but then I saw a bigger blue fish eat one! Very cool.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The last marvel I'm going to labour over explaining was our ascent. For context Chumphon is a really popular site and along with our boat full of 20+ divers there were 3 other boats, so it was busy. At our 6 meter safety stop we became surrounded by rising pillars of air bubbles being exhaled by divers below. We were shallow enough to feel the warmth from the sun, and the light shone down in rays and bounced off the air bubbles. This was more fantasy than Sci fi. It felt magical and glitzy like we were entering a mythical underwater nightclub. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our second dive of the morning was to Green rock, not green but more than enough rock to make up for it. There were triggerfish everywhere and we even saw the teeth on one. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We came back to a ghost town. The hostel is derelict, but the really nice shampoo that was left in the shower is still here! *wink wink* </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went out for our final dive at night. It was exciting to be given torches and descend into darkness but the novelty wore off quickly as it just felt very clumsy. Everyone was knocking into each other because we were made to stay closer. The sound of a boat was terrifying, we couldn't see it looking up but the sound reverberated everywhere and was completely consuming, Alex said he could feel it through his bones. We only saw a glimmer of bioluminescence which was disappointing but even with our torches turned off it wasn't pitch black just because of all the other divers.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got back, showered and warmed up and then made a bee line for Tiki's so we could have the best spring rolls in the world, for the last time. Somebody needs to get the Michelin man out there, it honestly is the nicest food on the island. We got spring rolls, obviously. I ordered a massaman curry and Alex got the fried vegetables with pork, and a fried egg over rice. Practically licked our plates clean then ordered mango sticky rice for dessert. Ended our time here on a real high, and Tiki even ran to give me a hug! </p>

						<div id="43">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 24-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Checked back into the DJL hostel, gave our scooter back and got the full deposit back even though Alex had dropped it! Budget looks happy, Alex is happy. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went out for our afternoon dives with Matt and Diana. Little bit disappointed that we were never given the option to pick our dives so we ended up going to White Rock and Twins again to learn peak buoyancy and navigation.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Diana turned up a full hour late and proved herself to be an even bigger liability when she and the instructor got lost practicing navigation and left me, Alex and Matt 17 meters deep by a submerged frame waiting.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Out of nowhere, I was so relaxed I didn't even realise, I started to float up, the air in my BCD obviously expanded as I ascended and for some reason I was really struggling to purge it. Mid panic and at least 5 meters up Alex turned around and realised. He shot up and grabbed my foot, and with his dive computer screaming at him for ascending too quickly emptied his lungs to drag us both back down slowly. Matt watched cluelessly and with limited communication asked 'okay?' 'Okay'. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We did more waiting, made friends with a curious fish that stayed close with us, gave each other puzzled looks and after periodically squinting into the blue expanse we realised mine and Matt’s air was getting low. Like well trained good little divers we did our safety stop for 3 minutes at 6 meters and just as we emerged there was our instructor frantically looking around for us, with Diana waving madly from the boat. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It had been a complete disaster, Diana and the instructor had swam around searching for us ages before they came up, and allegedly the boat had moved so the instructor was disorientated. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Back on the boat Alex and Matt were gushing over their expert safety stop. #</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our second dive felt aimless and I think I learnt more from Diana on how to do a forwards roll than I did from the instructor. We had fun though, Alex kicked me in the face and when I tried to mime it to him he was misunderstanding which made me giggle. This really concerned him which only made me laugh more, then my mask was getting flooded, he was panicking. I was laughing uncontrollably which he still didn't understand, it's only when I inhaled a nose full of water that I managed to stop. I can still laugh now about it, all I could see was his eyes like saucers watching thinking something was seriously wrong with me.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We surfaced from our second dive after we all successfully navigated a 30 x 30 m square. It was golden hour and we could feel the heat on our heads as we were ascending, then when we came up the sea was completely still and everything was basked in warm sunlight, it was so dreamy. Me and Alex sat on the top of the boat with our legs dangling down as we sailed away. I felt really blessed, but maybe that's just because Alex had brought me up an extra sweet cup of tea. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Calm After Dive.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We had a last meal with our little group as Dianna and Yelle were leaving that evening and Bart was going in the morning. It was a bit sad but the immense amount of food made up for it. We took Bart and Matt to the Hacienda for the pub desserts. Still think the sticky toffee pudding was best but Alex's carrot cake with cream cheese frosting comes a very close second...once again I didn't have time to get a picture.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">It took a lot to overcome our food coma from the previous night so we had a really lazy day. Met Yelle and Bart for lunch then went to DJL to book our advanced diving. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After peer pressure from the 'adults' me and Alex reluctantly went to finally get a Thai massage at sunset. We were recommended the full hour but I wimped out and opted for only 30 minutes. It was a lot of prodding about and the way she went in on my shoulder genuinely induced fear. I felt a bit lopsided afterwards because not everything done to one side of my back was mirrored. I didn't enjoy it much but Alex did, he had his fingers cracked! I would have immediately left had that happened to me.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Another day snorkeling, I don't think it could ever get boring here. Bart brought a friend he made from his morning Scuba diving, Yelle. Another very friendly Dutch man for Alex to show off free diving in front off. I'm being mean, we were all suitably impressed as Alex really does, without sarcasm, look like a son of Poseidon.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Son of Posioden.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We've got a little group now established with me, Alex, Bart, Yelle and Diana. We met up for a big meal of Korean hot pot and bbq. It was really great, we cooked food together and shared our favourite combinations. Diana started frying big chunks of pineapple at the end which was incredible! And we were surprised by chocolate and matcha Ice cream. As a group I think we really ate our money’s worth.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 21-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent the day hanging out with Bart again, and went for lunch at another beautiful look out point.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Cafe View Everyone.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Bart has decided to help Alex be less of a control freak and pressured him into letting me keep all our money. Alex had a look of anguish when he saw how I was, or rather wasn't organising the notes, and I had to really cram them into my purse. I was then made responsible for paying, which I did whilst Bart and Alex watched over like proud parents. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We returned to Shark Bay in another search for Whale Sharks and once again only found turtles. However, we did get to see two turtles coming together, and both me and Alex managed to separately find a quiet moment to swim alongside one. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">By chance Bart managed to capture us with his go pro.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Turtle.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Me and Alex then went for a highly anticipated Sunday Dinner at Hacienda. We decided to walk and in doing so witnessed a bike crash, or rather someone getting a 'koh tao tattoo' since they're so common here. The sound of screeching plastic was awful, tomorrow we go back to diligently wearing helmets. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I managed in the brief moment before we absolutely inhaled our food to get a picture, but I had no such luck when it came to dessert. We ordered a sticky toffee pudding and apple crumble, words cannot describe how utterly delectable they both were. We wobbled home with warm full bellies, having eaten every crumb from our meal.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="feb-week3"> 20-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Updates! Where were we....</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Today I hung out with our new dutch friend Bart whilst Alex was busy with his 2nd day free diving. We went to a tree house cafe, the view was fantastic and I finally had a coconut. Also I tried massaman curry for the first time, wish I'd discovered it sooner! New favourite meal. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Cafe View Bart.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Similar to yesterday, the day started with time in the classroom improving our breathing technique and learning some yoga/meditation to do in our free time. Because one of the lads in our group dropped out, I was moved to another instructor. This meant the fierce competition was stifled as me and the lad from London were now separated. Dives 1, 2 and 3 were set at 10, 15 and 20 metres respectively and just like that, I reached the bottom on all 3. With the pressure off I thought it would all be fun and games from there but I failed to equalise on a couple of goes which stopped me reaching any significant depth. After being told to shorten my breathe up, the equalisation issues let up and I made it to 20 metres a second time. I’d heard my instructor mention sitting at the bottom as we were close to a shipwreck and there were many fish around (I had spent time admiring them on my ascent). Armed with this knowledge I thought I’d sit at the bottom for some time and have a good look around. I got myself to 20 metres and as I went to take a look around, I tried to breathe in through my nose and got panicked so immediately began my ascent. Quickly I calmed myself but by the time I reached the surface I was grateful for the air.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Once Alex was finished we all met back up and went snorkeling on the East Coast. There was no beach so we had to jump straight in off the rocks but it surpassed all expectations. As a novice snorkeler I can't comment too much, but Alex agrees it's the best snorkeling he's ever done too. The coral was vibrant and healthy and the huge rocks extended below the water so we could dive down (some better than others *Alex*) and explore different depths and crevices. We also had fun playing with Bart’s go pro. We were in the water nearly 3 hours without even realising. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Bart loves coconuts almost as much as me and Alex love spring rolls so after swimming he took Alex as an apprentice and they went off to hunt down a coconut. I acted very impressed by their show of masculinity, prodding the tree with a big stick and then repeatedly throwing the coconut onto a rock to break through the husk. I have been awarded the title of Princess and accepted the coconut graciously. My role as Princess has become a very convenient excuse for not doing things. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Coconut Tree.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Alex Coconut.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">In the evening a group of us from the hostel watched the fire show on the beach together, Diana got flustered over one of the 'fire boys' and afterwards got his Instagram! Apparently the only accounts he follows were for cat lovers, so I don't think she'll bother pursuing. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Fireshow.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We all got food together and Bart was served his meal with an unexpected fried egg on top which we have come to assume is an apology egg because the lady told him he couldn't use the toilet when we first arrived and got really mad, thinking he wasn't staying for food. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Me, Alex and Bart then stayed out and played pool where Bart effortlessly socialised and strung us along with him so we ended up speaking to a lot of people. We also played beer pong and a beautiful dutch girl called Alex the 'ping pong king'. We only found out at the end of the night that the boy she was traveling with was in fact her brother, not boyfriend. Should I have been worried? ;)</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It was a really great day that we finished off with banana roti just before bed.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="38">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 19-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">I predictably did not get up to much on my own, I wimped out of riding the bike (the roads are far more chaotic here than on Yao Yai) so I just walked to a beach and sunnied myself, ate some tomato crisps, dipped in the sea and read my book. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">On a more exciting note here's what Alex got up to (in his own words).</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I woke up bright and early, leaving Erin in bed with her pocket money and keys to the bike she didn't use. My freediving adventure started with nearly 3 hours in a classroom learning breathing techniques, how to be super efficient descending and more. We got kitted up with some jumbo fins and after feeling a little nervous, I quickly got comfortable in the water. There were 2 different techniques: one was pulling ourselves down the rope the other holding our nose as we kicked. The fins made a huge difference and my first attempt with the kicking technique (which I thought was rubbish) came out at an easy 12 metres. Another lad there from London was confident and we both reached the maximum depth for today's dive of 14 metres on our 5th or 6th attempt. We'll see who wins tomorrow when the maximum is extended to 20 metres. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Back at the hostel we met Bart from the Netherlands, took him to Tiki's to try the immense spring rolls and Alex taught him how to play windows, I lost to them both. Learned about the all-in-one kitchen appliance that he develops as a job, then we played Rummikub. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">oh! I almost forgot, we went out for ice cream and saw this super adorable 'angel messages' so I picked one out, and replaced it with my own note.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Ice Cream.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">It is now however, only half 7, the hostel is dark and windowless and we have nothing to do because Alex has been told that he shouldn't drink if he's going to get down to 20 meters tomorrow.</p>
						</div>

							</figure>
							<p class="diary-entries">We're now in the hostel because we got 3 nights free with our diving that we didn't use at the time. Alex booked a freediving course for tomorrow, I was absolutely not going to join him in that, I cannot imagine anything worse but the diving school boasts an impressive set of professionals to learn from and reckons they can get even beginners down to 20 meters. Sounds terrifying. He'll be doing that for the next 2 days, I'll just be mooching around I suppose, pretending to be a strong independent woman and not the princess that I've been acting like. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Shark Bay.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to Shark Bay and naturally tried to spot ourselves a shark. Swam out 250 meters, saw a lot of dead looking coral and a few fish, 1 or 2 angel fish for me to stalk, they're so calming, but no sharks. Ready to head back when Alex grabbed my legs, absolutely huge turtle in the water behind us! He was just minding his own business, had fish attached onto his shell and a crowd of snorkelers sticking cameras in his face. After the initial shock and feeling of awe, I was getting sad watching everyone not give him space but just before I left him he floated up to the surface and among all the bobbing heads looking down I saw his small Dino head emerge like an old wise man among rounded idiots. I loved it.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Back at our hostel we met another couple traveling and joined them for drinks and food. They had just done their first day of the open diving course but the girl wasn't carrying on.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="36">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 17-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Day 3 complete! Certified open water divers right here! </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Sunny Diving.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">It's wild, the enjoyment I feel is so delayed. Now that I'm sat down with a hearty well deserved meal, I feel euphoric and very pleased with myself but I struggle to recognise that when we're actually diving. Before the dives I'm nervous, during the dives I'm suppressing terror and when I'm not too cold to move my arms, I'm fluttering my hands across my regulator and mask to check they won't spontaneously combust and disappear from my face. In-between dives I'm absolutely freezing and experiencing sea sickness for the first time ever but afterwards, I'm elated. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It's such an unfamiliar feeling for me to not understand myself this much, all that being said I think I'll do my advanced course, maybe I'm just a masochist ;) </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Today's dives were really cool, I saw a fish that looked just like a lemon! It's called a box fish but I couldn't stop thinking about how I always said growing up that I'd get a smiley face lemon tattoo and there it was! Just bobbing about in front of me in real life. It was so cute I couldn't believe it. We also saw something like a Stingray but it was pink! Really gave us the side eye. So many schools of fish just engulfed us and even the coral looked like it was alive and breathing. We did successfully reach 18 meters deep even if we did have to cut the last dive short because I was cold. I wish I had a fish encyclopedia with me because I can't commit that many different species to memory.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Armed with new recommendations from Kes, we went out and had the best spring rolls ever! They were as thick as my wrist and full of glass noodles, carrot and cabbage, no picture this time but we'll be back! Finally tried mango sticky rice too! Has to be one of the best days.</p>
						</div>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 16-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Day 2 of getting our open water diving certificate, Day 1 of actually experiencing open water and the weather was horrendous. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It rained all through the night and all through the day. The sky was gray, the sea was gray, and from how cold I was, I was also gray. Kes was the only one excited to get on the boat and dive. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I did get a full length wetsuit and a long sleeve baselayer in an attempt to keep me warm but unsurprisingly I was dithering still. Within minutes on the boat we were fully wet through, along with any clothes or towels we'd taken out with us. It felt harrowing, Alex would probably tell the story less dramatically. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Cloudy Diving.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The dive was incredible and with only a handful of skills left to demonstrate we could enjoy the dive site plenty. The coral is amazing and it feels so much more immersive than snorkeling. Deepest we went was 12 meters and because of the weather and reduced sunlight we were able to experience blue water diving, where you can't see anything besides a blue expanse in all directions. I generally try my best to not look up or down regardless as I have a lot of fear to suppress. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got back and hung our clothes up at the shop to dry. Had a few drinks with Kes and the other guy learning with us, Julian. Then we were invited out by another instructor and eventually ended up at a place called Baby Rasta. It was like being inside a kids secret den, there were different levels and ways around but it’s built like a tree house so you can see through all the sections. There were hammocks and cushions and occasional stools dotted around, it was all very haphazard and relaxed. Maybe we'll go back at some point. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I've made no more progress on the online learning that needed to be done. I'm writing this all in retrospect because I got in woozy and managed one bite of a chicken wrap before passing out asleep. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex was far more sober and stayed up eating, learning and overachieving. Kes peppered him with compliments over his natural affinity with water when we were out, I'd be jealous but there's absolutely no competition that Alex is better than me and finding the course easy. Hilariously the only problem Alex has is communication, who'd have guessed? We go over the brief, we go down into the water, Kes signals to do what we discussed and Alex is clueless. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Day 1 of getting our open water diving certificate, completed. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent the entire day in a swimming pool working on skills. The pool was a gorgeous infinity pool looking out infinitely onto the weed farm below, there was also a very mild current in the pool which I couldn't keep myself standing still in. Our instructor, Kes, kept having to move me away from the vent else I'd 'blow away like an Autumn leaf'.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Kes has even curlier hair than Alex and calls me darling. Alex has graciously allowed me to develop a small crush. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Overall the skills weren't too difficult: we learned to manually inflate our BCD, share air, do a controlled emergency ascent and how to enter the water from a boat. Obviously Alex took to it effortlessly. I struggled with having to remove my mask and put it back on underwater, really having to fight with myself to not spontaneously try to breathe through my nose and inhale water. I only really panicked once. I also struggle to keep myself neutrally buoyant, I'm either floating or sinking. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Think I must be the only person to feel cold in a tropical swimming pool, whilst Alex's scalp was being fried by the sun. I have no idea how to stop it, but Kes said he'll search around and find something warmer for me to wear for tomorrow's dive.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After 6hrs and nearly stumbling at the last hurdle to simply swim 200m, we were finished and sitting down for a well deserved meal of noodles and dumplings. The Dumplings were incredible, soft on top, crispy bottoms and filled with pork. It was great, then we just got back and slept for 14 hours.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Made the executive decision to postpone Valentine's day. I won't be forgetting about it, cash in that token the next time I see something I want to buy ;)</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Spent the majority of the day visiting Koh Nang Yuan. Only a short journey away and besides the iconic view point with the 3 small islands connected by a white sand Bank, it’s also a great place to snorkel.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Got a taste of home as we cued in line to get the picture on a rock, felt like a line at Alton Towers. Alex didn't even want a picture in the end! But enjoy this one of me since we waited long enough. Tried to hide the fact I was dripping with sweat by wearing the hat.</p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Erin Nang Yuan.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Went snorkeling for hours, stalked a rainbow fish and desperately tried to memorise the colours to describe later, then remembered we bought an underwater camera specially! Spent hours swimming around trying to capture every type of fish, Animal crossing style, I swam every inch of the bay, even carefully going across the coral, only to discover all the footage is jumbled up because of the reflections from the water and we needed to buy a specific case for the camera to stop that happening. Now I’m stuck trying to remember if my rainbow fish was more blue with pink, or pink with more yellow? Hoping when I have the time to go over all the videos we can find some small highlights to share because the fish were amazing! Whole cast of nemo was down there.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Very tired but I’ve predictably left the training material for tomorrow until the last minute so I've got to push through and get that done. Obviously Alex is already a module ahead. There's 5 sections to complete in total.</p>

						<div id="32">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="feb-week2"> 13-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent the morning trudging around trying to find a scooter to hire. Alex was understandably very uneasy about going somewhere that wanted to hold your passport as a form of deposit, which narrowed down our options considerably. I guess the locals have had bad experiences with tourists trying to return bikes that have been beaten up. We didn't manage to get a scooter until the evening so we weren't able to explore far. There is however no rush because we'll have plenty of time to see everything now that we're staying longer to complete a PADI diving certificate! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to Davy Jones Locker Diving School today and booked to start on Wednesday! We have all the e-learning to complete before then, initially very excited but having watched the first video tonight that consisted of 45 min info dumping I'm feeling overwhelmed. Very naive of me to not once consider the risks involved and now that I've seen a burst balloon being used as a metaphor for my lungs I am having second thoughts. I also stubbornly rebel against e-learning and the monotonous <i>try as many times as you need to get 100%</i> but Alex has made his position very clear in that we will be completing the quizzes independently after watching each video and taking notes. I've had fun 'acting up' and seriously stressing him out. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Spent some time at the beach in awe of how bright and clear everything looked. Prescription sunglasses are the best investment I have ever made, where have they been all my life?... Probably hiding behind the £200 price tag. I think we're going to love our time here! </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Another largely uneventful day traveling. Set off at half 8 from our airbnb and didn't make it to the next one until 3.30pm. The ferry was excruciatingly long and at 10mph I think I could have swam it faster with a pool noodle. Alex is poleaxed and sleep talking next to me right now. Apparently we 'need room to go kart'. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">There's a small town just down the road that we walked to, ate a day's worth of food in one meal and made it to the beach for the sunset. We took a little dip in the water as the sky turned the world into a parma violet haze and the water was clear and beautiful with the sun still reflecting pink on the surface. It felt very dream-like. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Tomorrow we will rent a scooter and be able to explore properly. I cannot wait to finally go snorkeling. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Only did a little bit of mooching around. We went to the same place for food as the first day here, where you write down your own order. I thought it was a little strange but today we heard the lady explaining it’s because when they first opened and were just serving food from their house they didn't have any staff to take the orders. It’s still only managed by a mum and daughter and it’s their way of remembering where their business started. Had the nicest noodle soup, tasted really clean and healthy. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I bought myself some super adorable Snoopy shorts that look like they were made from a kids duvet cover. They're ugly cute. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Samui\Snoopy Shorts.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We learnt that the two most precious gifts from nature come provided from a convenient street side dispenser. That being water, and petrol. It's crazy how similar the two machines look and operate, just pop in your pennies and press the green button! It does make you feel like they're on the same level which is concerning. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Spent a lazy hazy afternoon playing in the pool. Tested how long Alex could stay underwater with me giving him breaths of air. I was clumsy and not very quick,  he started panicking after 2 consecutive underwater kisses.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I also got Alex to try on my bikini but that's pay for view only. Very sexy and definitely not an ick.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We also had a pretend 3 legged race, without any rope to actually tie our legs together and without any competitors. Still, think we would dominate the sport, our timing was immaculate even at a light jog.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 10-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We slept in late and both got an excessive 12 hrs sleep. The bed here is the comfiest one yet. Spent a while looking for food, very underwhelmed by the options. We expected to find authentic little places tucked away like in Krabi and Phuket but Lamai seems to be far more geared towards tourism, which means higher prices for mediocre Western food. I think tomorrow we will have to search further afield. </P>
							<p class="diary-entries">Obviously we still have to eat, and waking up so late means the clock is ticking for Alex. We settled for somewhere and Alex showed himself to be a man of no principle. He has consistently told me, for weeks now, that banana splits are a joke. His hatred for them was surprisingly strong, but he really convinced me they were boring and just a way to get children to eat a banana. Well, you know where this is going. Here's the picture for proof. </P>

							<p class="diary-entries">We went to the beach, it had people and rubbish strewn across it and looked more than a little dreary but the waves coming in looked exciting. We waded out, I let myself get gently lifted by the waves whilst Alex threw himself around like a mad man. Then he decided I wasn't doing enough and had the bright idea to lie me flat and give me a push on a big wave, supposedly he planned for me to ride on top of the wave. I was on top of nothing and swallowed a gallon of water through my mouth and nose. Then I was just getting battered by all the breaking waves.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">We decided we'd have a good go at drinking in the evening but when we went out it was every bar fighting to have their music heard, playing dance music with nobody dancing. The people sitting around drinking all looked bored and after getting fried rice from the night market we went straight back home. We made a poor attempt to drink sake but with the bed so close we fell asleep earlier than planned. </P>
							<p class="diary-entries">I did take another apocalyptic image whilst we were briefly out. Very spooky looking moon over the beach.</P>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="koh-samui"> 09-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Wish I had more to say on our first impressions of Koh Samui but the coach and ferry ended up taking 6 hrs 30 and left us both feeling knackered. We couldn’t sleep on the coach because the driver was acting like he was on a scooter and treated the accelerator like an on/ off button so we were never at a smooth constant speed but were jerked around for the entire drive.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">From the ferry we caught a bus and had our backpacks thrown onto the roof, then the heavens opened with a vengeance and our bags got soaked. Nothing inside my bag got wet, but Alex was not so lucky. Worst of all, the soap for our clothes, that we had started to use very conservatively to make last, has leaked all over his toiletry bag. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We’ve landed ourselves in yet another lovely airbnb with a wonderfully friendly host. I smacked my shin on the metal footboard of our bed, I even made a big deal over warning Alex about it because it’s hidden under the bedsheets. Not even 30 minutes later I throw myself down onto the bed in a dramatic display of exhaustion and nearly knock myself out. I hit my temple not even a cm away from my eye on the same damn bedframe I specifically made a point over! I’m not too sure where the tears came from but I cried<i> a lot</i>. Alex after his initial slew of abuse calling me an idiot and telling me off for ‘floundering around’ did comfort me but it was too late and I could only ride out the self pity in full. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got food, I took this picture of the street and sky which I thought looked moody and foreboding. I hope tomorrow is better weather, and that I don't wake up with a black eye.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Happi in Krabi! It’s just for one night whilst we wait to get our bus in the morning up to Koh Samui but a great opportunity for us to revisit our favorite restaurant here and stock up on more banana bread from the night market! We also tried the softest fluffiest sponge cake ever, shame we only got one to share, it was 90% air and barely left an aftertaste. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We’ve done a bit of research on where to go after Koh Samui, decided to skip out Koh PhaNgan to spend more time in Koh Tao, hopefully find some clear water and fishes to spy on. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We cheaped out on the room for tonight and as a consequence our AC unit is broken. I think at this point it's actually blowing out warmer air than outside. Feels like it’s going to be a really long night. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Another day doing sweet nothing, we’ve lazed around at the beach having conversations in the sand and playing frisbee. </p>

							</figure>
							<p class="diary-entries">There appears to be a disproportionate amount of children living on the island compared to adults. The school looks big but it's not just that, there’s children ferrying each other around on scooters and nearly every scooter that does have an adult on, has a child crammed in somewhere! My conspiracy is that the island really belongs to children and they just employ a few adults to stand at food venders as a front. However, if the crabs decided to stage a coup they’d have the numbers. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Would have liked to do some night swimming at the beach like on Noi but the thought of millions of crabs all coming out of their tiny holes in the sand is enough to stop me. We finally saw a full sized crab today, they camouflage so well but I think Alex has temporarily traded in plane spotting for crab spotting, he likes chasing them until they throw themselves into the sea. The assurance that ‘they’re more scared of you’ is not enough to make me join in with any amount of commitment. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent hours riding across the entire island in the search for pancakes, the two places we found from google were closed. It was a fruitless effort and we once again settled for rice and noodles. Alex was appalled by the portion size more than usual. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Oh! Big news, I have gained enough confidence, and Alex has gained enough trust in me, that I have become a respected and skilled second driver on the scooter! As long as I wear my glasses we can take turns to ride first. It’s great fun but Alex still pulls a face having to sit at the back because it's less comfortable and I maybe can’t always see bumps in the road that I need to slow down for until we’ve hit them. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Gone out specifically to poach WiFi so we can update the website and download more from Netflix, but otherwise I think we would have stayed sitting on our porch playing windows for hours and completely forgotten to eat again. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Now with a full belly and only a slightly distracting reggae cover of 'country roads' playing from a radio, I’m free to write. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Yai\Cafe View.jpeg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Life feels good today, in the course of 24hrs me and Alex have enacted a typical story plot with rising tensions amounting in a major climax of emotional fallout at around 3am (it was very dramatic) but now we've made it to the turning point in our story where we come to many resolutions and can sit happily sipping coke and enjoying the sun together.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We've had a great morning, high tide was later today at 11am so we were at the beach with the white sand with plenty of time to enjoy it. We played more with the Frisbee and I tried out my new and improved breaststroke technique which I do believe I've made progress in. Alex has finally started to share his puzzle book with me so I was able to sit quizzically for a while with him and now my head feels as clear as the sky. We will frazzle in this sun for sure.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Yai\White Beach.jpg">

							<p class="diary-entries">Breakfast was slightly disappointing, we both specifically ordered 'pancakes with banana inside and on top' and what arrived were pancakes with only banana on top. It’s just not on, but no time to sulk because we had a long tail boat with our names on it... or rather the name of our next island Koh Yao Yai! A very quick 10 minute island hop.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our host made a real effort and met us at the pier with a scooter ready and taxi ordered to help us with our bags and our home for the next 3 nights is perfect! It's a farmstead but I've only seen a few chickens mulling about nearby. There's only two properties, ours and the neighbouring one with a Russian guy staying, it’s private and cosy. Alex said the walkways make it feel like the Maldives but without the water, which makes it sound a bit naff but ignore him, it's really nice.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We've rode down the entirety of the main road already, it doesn't feel like there's much more to explore which is baffling considering how much larger this island is compared to Noi but it feels so empty! I have no idea where the 1,000s of supposed residents live. The full extent of the town appears to be a 7/11 and 5 food vendors, it does feel like a quiet retreat. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to a beach covered in glorious fine white sand. The tide was out so we couldn't experience the beauty in full but plenty of time to return. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Yai\Erin Beach.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">I've realised that I have started to drink Thai tea as a replacement to my regular cups of tea at home, but I'll have to put a stop to it soon before I turn the same bright orange colour, it cannot be good for me and there's enough sugar in it to hold my straw up, almost. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We met a particularly earnest burger man that asked us after our meal if he could have done anything better, even though he gets a 5 star google review for just having mayonnaise and ketchup! </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">A replacement for Scoopy came this morning, this scooter is blue and just isn't giving the same energy.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had an easy day enjoying the sun, I tried in vain to even out some of my tan lines by the pool and then we went to the beach and played Frisbee thanks to Andrea (and Alex's determination to pack it). Then Alex went on a spontaneous jog around the beach and returned with a dramatic story about 1000's of crabs.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to pick up our bug spray that we had left in Scoopy from the women and when we arrived she smiled and pointed at Scoopy by the side of the road in a way to suggest 'good news the tire’s fixed' but Alex just looked over and said 'oh, there he is' which made me feel really sad. I think we need to socialise with other people more because we have both gotten tragically attached to the only other thing besides each other that has been around more than 3 days.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">On the subject of socialising, Alex made friends with a screaming child in the restaurant that we went to in the evening. He got her told off for being too loud and excited, which is no different to back home with Theo. He's such a bad influence. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Koh Yao Noi has been the first place that we've stayed at for 4 nights and haven't wanted to leave sooner. Really excited to see how Koh Yao Yai compares.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">'We'll explore the North of the island tomorrow' a fateful decision that might have become a key piece of evidence in a missing person investigation. Exploring the North became a disastrous adventure that eventually led us to a birthday party.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We rode on Scoopy (in hindsight we shouldn't have given the bike a pet name) down a winding road that snakes through the centre of the island. Unbeknownst to us using Google for directions, the road does not maintain itself as a usable road for very long and becomes a dirt path, then a rocky trail. Scoopy served us well but he struggled on the constant uphills. Eventually we had to accept that the trail is now completely inaccessible by bike, but Google promised we were close to the North most bay that we had been heading towards. We walked for 20 minutes through the jungle with a cliff edge to the right. In my happy oblivion I tend to not pay any attention to time or circumstance but Alex began to panic about it going dark and felt threatened by the sound of monkeys. We pushed on and found Mankei Bay which looked particularly beautiful under the bright moon, but then we had a raging argument which lasted the entire walk back to Scoopy, in admittedly the pitch black. Then we had to ride Scoopy down the rocky trail which was difficult in daylight and near impossible in the dark but you can trust Alex to not take any risks and ride slow. Very slow. Not that it made any difference because half way through the back tire went flat and we were stranded. No street lights, no houses, and no phone signal. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Noi\Mankei Moon.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We pushed Scoopy and Alex showed a glimmer of hope as he remembered the woman we hired the scooters from gave us her card to WhatsApp her if we were in any trouble. Funny thing is I knew that I had already squirreled the card away into my 'memory pouch' along with all the other cards, tickets and receipts I've collected, kept safe in my backpack, back at the airbnb. Alex didn't find it particularly funny. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Close to the beginning of the 'road' part a few people went past on scooters without stopping to help and in our crippling shyness we weren't about to call out but then, from the distance we heard 'Sawadee Ka' A little old women, our saviour, emerged from a house and through elaborate explanations with our hands we told her about the flat tire. She went next door to get her daughter, who called our airbnb for us. Our host then sent her grandson to pick us up, who arrived only 10 minutes later riding a beaten up scooter with a metal cage attached for us to sit in. Off we rode almost smoothly into the distance. Our driver had to shimmy a leg out and help push us up the hills, but we made it back to our place.</p>

							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Noi\Sunrise.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">After a regrettable nap which had us both waking up drenched in sweat inside our cabin that had become a hot box, we decided to take a dip in the swimming pool. Alex painstakingly tried to teach me a proper breaststroke, but he gave up and went back to his puzzle book and I have made no progress. Alex thinks secretly progress was made but I just don't know about it.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After 3 weeks and gradual complacency with suncream we are both sunburnt. Alex is more burnt than me and has already made me moisturise his back twice. We will be more careful going forward.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent a few hours riding around the island on the scooter, we'll explore the North of the island tomorrow. Alex let me drive the scooter to the beach in the morning but he has absolutely no trust in me and wouldn't stop panicking so now I have resigned to sitting on the back again. I don't mind too much though because I get to look around more.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Today brought around a real highlight to the trip. </P>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got a bus to the pier and then a speedboat to Koh Yao Noi. Trekked for far too long with our bags to a scooter rental place, the lovely woman gave us a discount for hiring a scooter for 5 days and helped us ride our bags to the airbnb because despite our best efforts we couldn't balance 2 people and 6 bags onto the scooter.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">We checked in to a cute cabin and said hello to both our neighbours (there's no WiFi in the room so updates will be slow again) then we ran the scooter just 5 minutes down the road to the closest beach, got there just in time to watch the sunset with not a single other person in sight. </P>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Noi\First Night Sunset.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We waded out into the water which even at high tide is barely waist deep, but it was incredibly calm. There we were just floating on our backs comfortably when I noticed a faint blue glow in the splash from moving my arm. I thought I'd imagined it! Bioluminescent plankton!! It was so unexpected, once we noticed it seemed to be everywhere. It was so incredibly magical, it rose up and scattered with every movement, rolling over our skin like dancing fairies of electric blue light. We took turns drawing attention to each other like children 'look at me!' Then performing elaborate waves and dances to draw up the most light and then giggling in wonder. I have no idea how long we spent out there in the dark, I think it's one of my favourite memories ever.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">Finished the night sat at the restaurant attached to the airbnb which the owner kindly kept open for us, and once he had closed up the kitchen he brought us a light so we could stay here whilst Alex catches up uploading the entries from the past few days. </P>

							<p class="diary-entries">Another similar day. No plans. Alex loves his puzzle book a little too much and has been consumed.</P>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Puzzle Book.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We went out specifically for dessert and tried Patongo, which didn't look too appetizing but tasted very much like a donut. Very funny that it came with scissors, dedicated to their banishment of knives. Alex especially enjoyed the drizzle on top, the pervert. </P>

							</figure>
							<p class="diary-entries">We'd planned to stay out a little longer but Alex had an 'embarrassing' encounter and being absolutely mortified made us go back to the airbnb. It wasn't such a big deal, but Alex brushed off a guy in the street who had said 'can I ask you a question?' The guy chuckled after Alex said no and we walked past, then we heard him ask someone else and realized he just wanted someone to take a picture for him. Alex felt awful. It was funny at first but following a night of self pity I couldn't laugh.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">Coming to accept there is no internet in this black hole. Music plays loudly from the hotel next door, but that's better than the previous night where fireworks were set off every 20 minutes.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">A late addition to the entry! There is a cockroach in the room! Saw it pacing across the room when we were playing cards. I was surprised that Alex was scared of it, he had his torch out to check where it had disappeared off to and was very preoccupied. He said 'of course I'm scared it's creepy'. It is rather big and admittedly creepy. The situation escalated when we tried to gently coax it onto the balcony and the result was Alex stood on a stool in the bathroom. Sadly I didn't get a picture.</P>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="jan-week4"> 30-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Spent today much like yesterday, I don't know why going out to explore Phuket doesn't really appeal.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">We did go out for food which again was really good, when we walked past a second time there was a queue waiting outside so must be highly rated. Then we walked to a huge stationary store, which is not quite the cultural experience we should be seeking out but it was a lot of fun. We also saw the Thailand equivalent to a lolly pop man! Much cooler, he helped us cross with a bunch of school kids.</P>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Lollipop Man.jpg" alt="Lollipop Man">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Erin with Drink.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex realised he accidentally left us without a night anywhere when he booked our next airbnb stay for the 1st of Feb and extended our stay here by only one night, there are 31 days in January. Being so last minute we've had to book another night here! 4 nights in a place we were only supposed to stay 2. Bored tirelessly and just want to move on but Alex cheered me up some by taking us to the Thailand McDonald's!</P>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Alex Burger.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We tried the Samurai Burger and cheese sticks which were exactly what we needed and the fries were super hot and crunchy. I made the mistake of getting the Pineapple pie to try which was disgusting, but proof that Alex will really eat anything, he gobbled that up too. He is however complaining of a sore jaw now as he has forgotten what chewing food feels like after so much rice and bite sized pieces of meat.</P>

							<p class="diary-entries">There is nothing to say about today. Alex spends an increasing amount of time with his hands down his pants. I suppose tonight we will continue to watch knives out for the third night as Alex refuses to take the hint that I'm not enjoying the film. </P>
							<p class="diary-entries">Sorry, for reals.</P>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Street Drinks.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We have both shamelessly had a very lazy day. Think I slept more than 14 hours last night and today. We didn’t leave the room until 6pm and I think that was only because hunger was getting harder to ignore. We aimed to visit the Sunday walking street market but for some reason all the streets around Old town were bustling with stalls and people, they even had wardens blocking the roads to cars. It was just too busy, you couldn’t possibly stand to browse the clothes or pick out snacks. We did buy a drink and I took a few quick pictures but we headed out of the busy streets as soon as we could. Eventually we found a little ramen restaurant, the food was delicious, but then after not eating all day anything might have tasted good. The fried prawns I know for sure were exceptional, we ordered them twice. </P>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Prawns.jpg">

						</div>
						
						<div id="16">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="phuket"> 28-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Not too much to say about today. We checked out at 11 and said goodbye to Krabi, which I think has been my favourite place on the trip so far. The bus to Phuket was only 3.5 hours on a relatively comfortable coach, however Alex was sat on a very determined recliner seat that would not stay upright despite his best efforts. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Only left the airbnb to get dinner. Another good meal, I think we’re back on a winning streak in that department. Hoping to sleep off the tiredness in my legs from the Temple yesterday and start tomorrow bright and early ready to explore Phuket old town. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="15">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 27-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Lay in bed feeling really sleepy and content. We’ve had a really good day, finished off with especially delicious food and now i’m exhausted and happy looking forward to a long undisturbed sleep. It really is a charmed life. I will have to save all the details from today to fill in tomorrow morning. Now I must sleep and think happy thoughts.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries" style="border-top: 20vh">We rented a scooter and went to the tiger cave temple. 1,260 very steep and uneven steps to ascend. We got there early just as several schools were getting back on the coaches. One girl called over that I was pretty and another asked for a photo with me. Then I was swarmed by school girls waiting to get pictures. I felt so awkward and self conscious but they were all so friendly I didn’t know how to say no. Think that's the most popular I’ll ever be. Two boys went to Alex and shook his hand, but when he introduced himself they giggled and ran off. It was an unexpected start to the day. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Climbing the steps to the temple felt very intensive, and I will admit that half way up I told Alex I physically could not make it to the top, but then we were passed by two 60 year olds that said ‘shame on the both of you’ and then a mother literally carrying her 3 year old on her back. I piped down then and dragged my sorry ass to the top. </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Tiger Budda.jpg" style="margin-top: 12vh; margin-bottom: 16vh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The view was incredible, the south was completely flat and to the north were huge limestone cliffs and forests. It was worth the climb. A monkey tried to steal Alex’s water bottle again! I'm not worried about Alex giving it up though, he’s taking no prisoners. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Tiger View.jpg" style="margin-top: 21vh; margin-bottom: 26vh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Erin View.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we went on an hour-long ride to visit the emerald pool. I might have enjoyed the journey more than the destination, it was so relaxing sitting on the back holding onto Alex and just watching the scenery go past. The pool was still very fun, couldn’t really get a picture and it was quite busy but freshwater always feels nicer than sea water, and it was in fact very emerald in colour. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">I think the real highlight of the day for us both was going to the hot spring waterfall. I read afterwards that the water temperature is between 40 to 50 (DEGREES). It was so toasty warm, with several natural pools to swim and bob about in. It was very cool, although I thought Alex was dead at one point, he was floating face down holding his breath for an uncomfortable amount of time.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">On the subject of things nearly being dead, Alex spooked a dog going past on the scooter and nearly ran it over. Anyway! live laugh love, look at the delicious food I ate for dinner.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="krabi"> 26-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Early rise and early escape, very happy to be leaving the hostel and moving on. It was a lot of fun to ride one of those open buses that you can dangle your head out of. Scenery was beautiful. We’re only staying in Krabi 2 nights as a mini pit stop before heading out to one of the islands. We’re currently undecided on which one to aim for. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Open Bus.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">The day was feeling really productive, we checked in early, showered, did some washing and headed out with a little to-do list and ready to explore. Thus far we had done well to ignore our cravings for familiar food, but my quest to find salt and vinegar crisps had been unsuccessful and Alex wanted a meal that would touch the sides of his stomach and rice/ noodles wasn't cutting it anymore. Feeling as though we were in safe hands at the sight of HP sauce on the table, we made the united decision to order western food. Alex chose an American style breakfast, I went for a ham and cheese toastie. First red flag was being told they had no toasties, but I could have a grilled cheese sandwich. I should have turned back then. Both our meals were awful. Admittedly not the worst thing we’ve eaten here, but by far the most disappointing. We were near heartbroken, my toastie imposter had fake cheese, and Alex had a giant plate with 1 sausage, 2 rashes of bacon and 1 fried piece of ham rolling about. There were also 2 dry pieces of bread disguised as toast and 2 eggs with runny whites and hard yolks. We tried our best to get over it quickly. Alex was of course, still hungry.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The next few hours were a big success, we sorted out a sim card for my phone, stocked up on toiletries and explored the food market in and around Krabi town. We tried takoyaki and different meat skewers, watched our chicken with cashew nuts get fried up in a wok and even found mini banana bread cupcakes! </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Lady Cooking.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then Alex took us on an exciting tour of every single ATM in Krabi searching at first for one that didn't charge a flat rate of 220 THB, they all do, and then for one with a better exchange rate. It was no use. After accepting these facts and in defeat trying to withdraw the maximum amount of money, as to minimize the amount of withdrawals we would need in the future, we then realized that our international bank card has its own set limit of £300 per withdrawal. Alex then kicked the ATM and declared we would be leaving Thailand tomorrow! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I think that’s highly unlikely but please wait on bated breath for the next update. In the meantime enjoy this picture of happier times before the search for the mythical ATM machine. We didn't know how to pay for the photo booth so settled on taking a picture outside it.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 25-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had planned to go to a ‘secret beach’ but since waking up it has rained on and off all day. After doing nothing yesterday I was going a little stir crazy so we ventured out for food. Same question as last time ‘left or right?’ Only 2 directions to walk in because there’s only 1 road… the ‘off the beaten track’ gimmick got old quick. This time we went left. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After 45 minutes walking down the one and only road, it did get more interesting with a lackluster ‘tourist promenade’. There was only one place open for food and a scattering of shops. I think we were the first customers to enter those shops in 10 years. We went into three shops, on the hunt for salt and vinegar crisps, and they got increasingly weird. The first shop only felt abandoned, the shelves were sparse and dusty but there was an actual shopkeeper at a till. In the second shop there was nobody inside except a woman asleep on the floor, and the individually wrapped sandwiches had an infestation of those teeny tiny bugs I see everywhere. The third shop was legitimately abandoned, but by this point i’d already eaten the banana sponge cake I’d bought from the 1st shop, and wanted to try the coconut one I’d found in the 3rd, so we awkwardly waited and shuffled about barefoot until someone spotted us from the adjoining house. It felt as though we’d walked off the map in a game. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Snack Haul.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">There was hardly any traffic to go past us on that last stretch of the road, and by the time we had been inside the shops the only thing around besides ourselves was 1 scooter ferrying a woman in a sidecar. The scooter sounded like it was being run on washing up liquid. I don’t think an actual bubble machine sounds as much like a bubble machine as that scooter did. Pop pop pop as it turned the corner, barely moving faster than we walked. Alex was overjoyed when it went past a second time. It was so zany. Walking back and catching the monkeys hosting a roadside meeting barely registered as weird after everything else. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Monkey Road.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We didn’t do much else all day. For dinner we went to the only other place we hadn’t already gone to in a 10 mile radius. I was served up a steaming hot bowl of bean sprouts, and Alex got buzzed on undiluted strawberry syrup. Still our first glimpse into Thai television was interesting as we intently watched the foreign drama on TV above our heads. Understood absolutely nothing about what was going on, watched regardless, little chuckle when the lizard crawling across the screen lined up with someone’s face. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our recent interactions with locals has been very limited as language has proved to be a big barrier, we usually just smile politely and point at the menu to order food, which is exactly how it had gone this time (with less success because I obviously didn’t want a heap of bean sprouts for dinner). The woman serving was very reserved and quiet, up until the point she launched a melon at our table and couldn’t stop laughing. I think she accidentally dropped it when tidying up the fruit display but it hit our table with such force that Alex and I both shot upright in our chairs. It really tickled her up and the three of us took turns laughing for ages afterwards. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">I somehow slept worse than the night before, it is never quiet, also I have 7 bites on my legs! We agreed on hanging around the hostel and having a lazy day. Alex has promised to take more pictures of me, without me always having to ask, so here’s me in the hammock. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Erin Hammock.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">Fun and novel but not awfully comfortable to lie in, and as Alex discovered, not easy to jump out of quickly when there’s a monkey trying to steal your stuff! The monkeys have gotten bold today. One snuck up on Alex’s bag when he was in the hammock and went to grab his water bottle, wish I'd have gotten a photo of the moment Alex snatched it back from him. The monkey looked shocked! Pulled such a surprised face with his mouth wide open before backing away. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The war between dog and monkey has also escalated. We were sat eating lunch when we saw a very organized advance from the monkeys, one went in first as bait for the dogs, drawing their attention to the jetty as the others ascended on the hostel slowly. I wonder if the owner of the hostel calculated exactly how many dogs he would need to ward off a population of monkeys. It took every wagging tail to keep them back today. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Monkey.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">The book I'm reading is increasingly disappointing and with little else to do I went for a daytime nap, glad I did because I'm in for my worst night yet. I’m not super scared of much, but I am absolutely terrified of rodents. My biggest fear has come true, there is some sort of mouse or rat living in the roof of our hut. We haven’t seen it, but I can’t think what else the noise could be. The mosquito net will provide no comfort, as surely it could chew straight through? I can’t cope. Alex will have to knock me out tonight. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="11">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="jan-week3"> 23-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Heard lots of miscellaneous nature noises all night. There's also a giant cage full of birds at the entrance to the hostel that look like parrots except they don't talk, which might have been cute, no, instead they just make an awful racket. Of course there is also the familiar early morning calling from the mosque. Slept horrendously. I've also been eaten alive and I can't understand how because I haven't really seen any flies and we slept under a mosquito net.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We rented a kayak to take out to the island, the distance was very deceiving. It took 30 minutes of relentless paddling to reach the first island that doesn't even have a beach to stop on. Alex wouldn't allow any breaks, not even to enjoy the view as we were 'losing ground'. It was not fun. We got to the second island after another 15 minutes which is supposedly 'Monkey Island' but we've seen more monkeys at the hostel than there! Alex cut his foot quite badly on some rocks whilst swimming, then threw a paddy because he expected clearer water for his efforts. I still thought it was a nice little alcove, especially when the sun shone through the clouds.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Monkey Beach.jpg">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Bleeding Foot.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex had just finished getting angry over me frolicking with the camera on unusually boggy sand, where I could 'easily have tripped and dropped the camera onto a rock' (an unlikely worst case scenario) when a giant killer wasp started checking out our kayak. I have since googled and discovered it is called an Eastern Cicada Killer. The thing was honestly so big, I think it was attracted by the scent of fresh blood. On the small beach there wasn't anywhere for us to go so we waded into the water hugging each other and anxiously waiting for the first move towards us. It came, we both panicked and then Alex did the unthinkable: he pushed me into the wasp, away from himself. I screamed and cut my foot on a rock falling. The wasp promptly left us alone then. Alex swears he pushed me only to bat the wasp away. It has caused a rift between us. Trust has been lost, and I'm not willing to put myself in that danger again for him to prove himself. I joke, but he did really do that, and it did really make me cry for a bit.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Killer Wasp.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">The paddle back was easier but we still slept for 3 hours afterwards. Then we got caught in another rainstorm whilst out for food. Pathetically, I did get a little chilly out in the rain, but the walk back was worth it. Lightning lit up the sky sporadically from different directions.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">I think we took it for granted in Malaysia how fluent everyone that we met was in speaking English. I read this morning that Thailand’s English proficiency ranking among non-native English speaking countries has been ranked one of the lowest. I had suspected as much from the bus transfers the other day when we were addressed only by ‘ao nang?’
							<br>*we nod our heads*
							<br>then a point ‘ao nang’
							<br>hastily grabbing our bags to move to the pointed at bus
							<br>‘ao nang?’
							<br>*another nod of our heads
							<br>‘ao nang’
							<br>*gets on bus*
							</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">If more confirmation was needed then it came today. We ordered our taxi from our airbnb to take us to the hostel. As promised ‘The bananas, off the beaten track’ was in fact off the beaten track and so not a very appealing journey for the taxi who once seeing our destination tried to cancel. We then strenuously tried to communicate an agreed upon new price, with the driver having to speak into google translate, Alex typing back and then also having to communicate we needed to hop onto his hotspot to cancel the journey on the app. We got there in the end.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our hostel is perfect, very relaxing. Our hut is made from bamboo, there are hammocks and benches everywhere, monkeys in the trees and kayaks to rent. Alex immediately went to extend our stay from 2 days to 4. I think he wants to settle down for a little bit and go slower. </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Alex at Hostel.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Since getting here we’ve sat down in the common area playing rummikub and hanamikoji and wandered down the road a short distance for dinner. We walked past some children playing who called out to us, we waved and said hello, they returned the greeting but then also shouted ‘potato’. We walked past them a second time and the bravest introduced himself, so we told them our names. They were happy to try out ‘Alex’ but I got blank stares for my name, I don't think they liked it.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">There's a wooden pier here and apparently when it’s high tide at night there’s fluorescent plankton! Really hope we get to go swimming and see.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Sat here writing whilst Alex works on the website and finally we’re experiencing a rainstorm! I don't know how we avoided it so long, it sounds lovely on the bamboo roof we’re sitting under. Feeling very cosy and relaxed, our sandles left outside however are getting soaked.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We both didn't sleep well last night, Alex reckons it's because the air conditioning made so much noise it sounded like the building was going to fall down. It also pissed out water the entire night, luckily Alex in a sleepy daze moved his bag from underneath after the first drop.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had an argument this morning with our toothbrushes still in, comedic relief didn't come until after. I can't even remember what the argument was over now.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The promised sunshine came so we took a long tail boat to Railay Beach. Filled our bellies with pad Thai, spring rolls and samosas before lazing around swimming and napping on the sand. I think there was something in the water, Alex isn't sure but both of us whilst swimming felt stings like tiny bug bites, sometimes it would really hurt. No idea what it could be.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">My bracelet gains another bead, the Indian Ocean: completed. Although Alex would like to note that technically it was the Andaman sea that we were in.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Railey.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">On the boat back we met some fabulous Thai ladies, then we played our made up game sharks and spoons in the pool together. Alex got a little too playful and tried to hold me down in the water and in my panic I kicked him as hard as I could square in the chest. No hard feelings.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We took a night time nature trail on our way to dinner (5 minutes around the corner). Spotted 4 dogs, 2 cats, 2 lizards and 2 toads!</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Toad.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">I've been ordering Thai tea as a replacement for my regular brew, it does usually taste a bit different but the one I had tonight tasted exactly like how incense sticks smell. Specifically those strong Indian ones Nag Champa, If you’re still not sure what I mean then walk into Salsa's, Warrington.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I think we are finally in the habit of staying awake all day now! Alex may be asleep next to me fully dressed and with his phone still in his hand, but it's 10pm so he's fared well.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Went to the office we booked our bus to Krabi with at 5am and the bus wasn't there. Alex went through the works, we called the 3 different numbers for them, none answered. I sat patiently like a faithful dog, Alex stressed. After 30 long minutes it finally turned up! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were bundled in and out of 3 different buses and the final and worse bus typically was the one we'd be in the longest. 11 hrs in total spent upright on a bus seat smaller than the ones on a plane. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We crossed the border easily at least, and our airbnb is right by the jetty to visit Railey beach. We took a dip in the swimming pool here but the water wasn't clear and started to irritate Alex's skin. Alex also started to lose his mind because he couldn't plug the adapter into any of the sockets because on every single plug socket in our room is a closely placed switch. He was really panicking and for some reason all I could do was giggle. He found one behind the TV from the 80s.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">First impressions of thailand: people will carry anything on a scooter.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">The bus to Penang was peachy but by god I have some higher force to thank for surviving the taxi to Georgetown. Absolutely terrifying, it feels like every time we're in a taxi we're living off borrowed time. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Penang is really pretty, I've included the picture taken of the road our airbnb is on. Chinese New Year is only 3 days away so all the streets and shrines are decorated. Our host recommended a food market for lunch, I got a delicious clay pot chicken. We went back for dinner it was so nice. By far the two yummiest meals I‘ve had yet.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Penang\Street.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">I know that after hallucinating a spider the other night that I've lost some credibility but I swear I saw an alligator today! Alex doesn't believe me and it had swam away by the time I called him back to look. It was in really shallow murky water.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Penang\Jetty.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex makes us walk everywhere and lies about how long journeys will take, even though it was so much hotter than in the Cameron Highlands. I complain lots and will only be pacified by frequent breaks. It was during one of our pit stops when we found 'Adore Art Cafe'. Had the nicest fresh apple juice, we literally watched as he cut and blended a full apple. So sooo good, I could really taste the granny smith, and Alex joined a band! (He went shy)</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Penang\Adore cafe.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">The next 2 hours were spent in Alex's personal hell of a shopping mall turned bus station with a 4 lane main road running through the middle. We walked round and round in circles trying to find a coach company that could take us to Krabi, Thailand tomorrow. I trailed behind still buzzed from my apple juice, role playing race across the world. I thought Alex might have imploded first but we did eventually find somewhere.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Thailand tomorrow! Very excited. We've already booked 2 nights in an airbnb and 2 nights in an 'off the beaten track' hostel in Ao Nang.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Leaving Penang on a positive note.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Last night I had a sleepy hallucination where I saw a spindly looking spider right in front of my face as I was falling asleep, when I jumped up and flashed my torch around I couldn't see anything. It happened again when I was actually asleep but I seemed to know that wasn't real and didn't panic. So far the only creepers that have bothered me are the tiny bugs I saw on that first night, they're everywhere.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We hired a scooter for the morning expecting to sight-see all the farms and plantations but instead we fell into the twilight zone. The highly recommended Lavender Garden ended up being a tiny tourist trap made from plastic and bright paint. We wondered about roadside souvenir shops selling plastic decorative garlic and themed Jaws cards...without the theme. It felt so bizarre and illusory. There was also a 'time tunnel' museum which looked like rooms full of old tat but after being ripped off so brazenly by the Lavender Garden we didn't bother.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">With nothing better to do we took our chances with the butterfly farm which was actually quite cool. It did get overwhelming quite quickly, and Alex was freaked out because some of the butterflies had broken wings and he was preoccupied by the idea that something in there was stalking the shadows ready to clip his wings too, in fairness there were giant spiders in boxes randomly scattered around. The butterfly farm had an unadvertised regular farm in the back with all sorts of mad animals, and a dirty looking aquarium.</p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\Butterfly 2.jpg">
					
							<p class="diary-entries">Next we met up with a few people from yesterday's walk and took an 'illegal' walk in the mossy forest lookalike (apparently it wasn't the mossy forest). Our hostel gave us directions but a tour guide on the trail told us we couldn't enter without a guide, unsurprisingly. We carried on 'at our own risk' and only took 20 minutes. Here's Alex first to reach the top, posed proudly with the flag.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\Alex Flag.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">Me and Alex have taken to winking a lot at each other and making games from anything i.e guessing which foot Alex is tapping under the table. I think we are bored. Similar to KL, our stay at Cameron Highlands felt like one day too many.</p>
						</div>

						<div id="5">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" style="margin-top: 80px;"> 17-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">The morning hike ended up being a great decision, even if it was far more intensive than expected. Took us 4 hrs in total, in a group of 9. Me and Alex accidentally dressed matching, green shorts white t, just in case there was any doubt we were together. We were the only 2 to not get covered in mud, which was lucky because we were also the least equipped, everyone had teased me over my freshly cleaned white trainers but they held up well. At one point Alex went rogue and decided he would jump down onto precarious platforms to get down a steep section rather than shuffle down holding a rope, which would have been fine if he hadn’t recommended others to try. The first, and last person to try following his lead almost missed the platform entirely, landed on her stomach and in doing so threw her water bottle (which Alex thankfully caught). She wasn’t hurt, out of everyone she fell the most anyway. At another point I was nearly pushed off the edge helping someone up, the fall would have killed us both and I was holding her entire body weight with both hands. Somehow we all made it up to the top for a nice group picture, and with only half the group making a wrong turn we all made it back down to the cafe at the bottom where I finally, after 6 days, got to enjoy a cup of tea. </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\Rope Climb.jpg">
					
							<p class="diary-entries">The caveat to making it back to the hostel however was that we needed to hitchhike. The volunteer at the hostel said it was the norm and everyone gets picked up within 5 minutes. We must have stood there waving and smiling at cars for over 45 minutes before anyone got a ride. I feel like it was my impromptu dance that got us ours. We got in the back of a lovely Malaysian womens car who was driving with her tiny 1 yrs old baby.</p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\Alex Hiking Tea.jpg">
			
							<p class="diary-entries">We got food with our newly made friend and invited them to join our team for the trivia quiz in the evening, then back at the hostel one of the girls from the hike bought cake to celebrate her birthday so we had some of that. I outed Alex’s party trick of naming the capital city of every country, he tried to act embarrassed but I know he enjoyed everyone firing countries at him and getting them all right.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\A+E in Tea.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">Needless to say our team, Air Heads, comprising of me, Alex and our very quirky friend won the trivia quiz. Alex did most of the work but I feel like I filled in the gaps nicely. We won a can of beer each and the overall losers had to try durian. The hostel still smells of it now. The quiz felt a little biased since it was the Scottish volunteer that chose the questions, however we forgot the national animal of Scotland anyway. I say our friend was quirky, they’re very upfront and outspoken, another team asked what a mammal was for the question ‘which is the only mammal that can fly’ and they announced ‘birds lay eggs, mammals push babies out of vagina’. They also said ‘wow they must know nothing’ about the losing team. They are French, so rather than it being rude it comes across as cool and edgy.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">That’s all for today folks! I showed the pictures from today's Hike to my Mum and she said it looks like the UK :)</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Day 1 staying in a hostel. Getting the coach to the Cameron Highlands went smoothly. Freaked Alex out when I told him I could read his mind then proceeded to guess correctly what number from 1 to 10 he was thinking of, then what colour, and then what card from a deck! We had to stop there because Alex looked like he might cry, it’s never a good sign when someone starts questioning ‘This isn’t real’ referring to reality.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The hostel is nice and clean but I feel uncomfortable and unbearably shy. Alex has signed us up to do a morning hike with anyone else that wants to join but I'm praying he changes his mind. More good food, and now considering we missed our usual siesta I think we’ll go to bed early.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Feeling excited to explore the town and surrounding farms tomorrow, and we may even decide, very tentatively, to be a little sociable. Alex however has a dry cough and thinks his wisdom teeth may be pushing through so maybe we won’t!</p>

						<div id="3">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" style="margin-top: 80px;"> 15-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Early start, wanted to visit the Batu Caves before it got busy. Alex made us rush to catch a train that actually wasn’t due for another 20 minutes. Still, it is always good to check your cardiovascular health, a workout from hell. The batu caves were worth the visit for only £1 each for the train and free entry inside. Think I prefer big statues to big buildings, will seek out more.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Kuala Lumpur\Batu Caves.jpg" alt="Batu Caves">
							<p class="diary-entries">Lunch was unexpectedly adventurous. I ordered a bowl of noodles the same as the woman next to me was eating because it looked good, without realizing all the meat was random offcuts from a cow. We successfully identified a tongue and an artery…or vein? The rest was so bizarre we had no idea. There was a dry looking slice of meat that had the consistency of an undercooked courgette, and cubes that looked like liver but were tasteless and very much like jelly, and a beaten up pale meat that tasted like chicken. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Alex went in like a mad man, but I did eventually try everything too. The tongue tasted like condensed kidney which was really not nice, but everything else was fine. Alex liked the bits of crackling on top most.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We did a little wandering and then ordered our first grab taxi to go to Masjid Wilayah Persekutuan (The Federal Territory Mosque). Without a moment's hesitation we were scooped up from the entrance and taken in. I had thought my full length trousers and long shirt that I had worn for visiting the Batu Caves was respectful enough but I was given a pink abaya and a head scarf to wear. Don’t think the look suited me but I was happy with the colour choices. The tour was really interesting, Azlin took us around, explaining the buildings architecture and religion. A few assumptions were made, "We all agree that there is one God right?" *Reluctantly nods head like sheep* I won’t be converting to Islam anytime soon but it was great to learn and get some pictures. Our volunteer tour guide gave us her contact details before we left in case we ever got into any trouble and needed help. Apparently it wasn’t just a kind gesture because whilst we were there a woman turned up after having her bag stolen with her passport inside. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Alex’s cool facade has finally cracked and I watched as stress visibly seeped in. We went to Jalan Alor for dinner, a busy food street. Food was incredible and we maybe got carried away ordering dishes to try so the total was more than expected and pushed us over budget. We’d also slept in the afternoon again and not headed out until late and Alex was anxious to pack before morning.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries"> Day 2 in Kuala Lumpur. Rocky start, woke up after a terrible nightmare and then found my toothbrush that I left out by the sink last night (without its plastic topper on) covered in teeny tiny bugs, freaked out and had to get my hunky man to shake them all off. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> Cheered up very quickly when we made it to our morning slot for the rooftop pool. Absolutely incredible view and it felt so good to swim. We got there not long after sunrise so really got to appreciate the sun moving higher and temperature slowly rising. We had the pool entirely to ourselves for the first 15 minutes, and then were joined by only 2 others. Cannot wait for our evening slot tomorrow so we can see all the buildings lit up.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Kuala Lumpur\Alex in Pool.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries"> We headed out without a plan and made our way towards the Petronas Towers. I was feeling really upbeat initially but very quickly felt overwhelmed and anxious, little food stalls and markets were crowded and with all the cars and scooters about too I was worried about getting in someone's way. We got food from a place that had the atmosphere and layout of a school canteen, and was served some variation of a nasi lemak. I didn’t get a picture because it looked as unappealing as it tasted, however Alex inhaled all of his, and then some of mine. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> We walked past a really beautiful cemetery. It was filled with so many different plants, and was well looked after. You can see from the pictures but I think it looked especially beautiful because it was surrounded by the city buildings, whilst being incredibly green, vibrant and peaceful. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Kuala Lumpur\Graveyard with PT.jpg">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Kuala Lumpur\Graveyard.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries"> We sat in KLCC park whilst I lost my body weight in sweat and Alex sat beside me smiling and relaxed, then we bought a sim card, drank pepsi that tasted completely different to usual, and then ventured into Chinatown. Food again was a little strange, but even so I managed to get some on me. Now my white shorts have splashes of orange which I need to clean asap before Alex can question why in the hell I brought white shorts in the first place. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> We bought iced watermelon smoothies, Alex’s came with tapioca pearls which he very impressively was able to shoot into my mouth from his straw. Then we thankfully got the train back and I fell asleep for the remainder of the afternoon. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> Alex booked our bus tickets to the Cameron Highlands, and I reluctantly booked our first hostel stay in a shared dorm with capsule beds. Trying to be as open minded as Alex, who so far has not been phased by anything. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="january-date"> 13-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">I don't want to write about the goodbye. I can’t think about it in retrospect because it still hurts. Alex did a great job comforting me, even if he did literally have to drag me onto the plane crying. The food on flight was relatively nice, however Alex’s Dad had set expectations high.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> Since landing we’ve gotten a bus, a coach and a train to get to the airbnb apartment, which has only given chance for the overall impression that Kuala Lumpur is tropical and green. Very green. The room is nice, Alex spoke to the other flatmate staying in a different room, Joe from Jakarta.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went back downstairs where they have a few shops, koi fish pond and cafe just to get water then we were showered and asleep. Alex hadn’t managed to sleep at all on the flights so he was completely poleaxed. We slept through our time slot for the infinity swimming pool which was disappointing, made worse by the fact Alex did not neglect to wake us up promptly for his 3hr long speed awareness course. Mild argument ensued, I felt that only half waking someone up to ask the question ‘do you want to be asleep?’ was not a fair way of deciding whether I wanted to wake up to go swimming, but this isn’t a courtroom and I apparently did say that yes, I wanted to sleep.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">That’s all I have to say about the day, hardly an exciting start but an entire day of traveling was never going to make the highlights, however I am preemptively going to mention before Alex proof reads and uploads to the website, that we got the Boeing 787-10 and it was very impressive even if i did forget to get the pictures of it that he asked for. We also got a view of the second largest building in the world from the window of the coach. I will let Alex pass final judgement on which, the plane or the building, was most impressive in his opinion. </p>
