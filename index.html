							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="siargao"> 08-06-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">I have never felt such rage in my entire life, I didn't know how to cope. We got off the boat 2 hours late and stood in line at 5:20am to buy our next boat tickets from Surigao to Siargao. The next boat was at 6am. There were less than 15 people in front of us in this line and it somehow took over an hour to reach the front, with a whole family shamelessly pushing in front. We missed the 6am boat, even though it was completely feasible that we all made it, and the next boat wasn't until 10am! Almost 4hrs away! I was still seething when we sat down. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After waiting, catching the 10am boat and arriving in Siargao we then found a bike rental place where Alex only rented one bike when he promised me we would get two. With only one bike (although I will give him credit for getting a great deal on it) we had to cram both our large backpacks into the foot space below the handlebars, and wear our smaller bags. It was so uncomfortable and Alex had nowhere for his legs to rest and so rode the entire way with them suspended above the ground. The ride took a grueling 1 hour with several breaks for Alex and honestly, we should have just gotten me a bike for the day, would have been far more comfortable and actually fun, but anyway we reached our beach hut across the island and thus concluded our full, draining 24 hours of travel. I have begged Alex to consider flying back to Cebu. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Siargao\Hut.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Siargao\Hut View.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The beach hut is lovely and the view of the sea is incredible, it's like we have our own private slice of sea. Naturally the first thing we did after our host left and we dumped our bags inside was quickly change and throw ourselves into the water. It was low tide with the waves breaking in the distance and so what we actually cooled off in was one of several natural pools with sandy bottoms and grassy sides. The water was crystal clear and no deeper than waist height. I imagine at high tide they are engulfed by the sea.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After nature's bath Alex sat down to do a puzzle at the table and was asleep at the drop of a hat, I woke him up to go out for dinner which we did at the unimaginatively named 'Women's Kitchen' and then we went back and Alex sat down again and I found him asleep, again. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Siargao\Alex Up.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Siargao\Alex Down.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We bought ice cream to make smoothies tomorrow, but right now I'm going to join Alex in bed even though it is only 5pm. What an awfully long day.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="146">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 07-06-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Smoothie bowls again for breakfast, we are slowly working our way through the menu and Alex is pleased to know that Siargao, where we will hopefully be in 2 mornings time, also has a Shaka. Then we returned the bike and said goodbye to Moalboal. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The bus was uncomfortable but we arrived in Cebu just shy of 5pm with enough time to grab dinner. This time I voted to try a Jollibee contender, Chowking. Essentially Chinese fast food we had noodles, gloriously crispy sweet and sour chicken, bao buns and fried rice. It was all delicious and preferable to Jollibee however I was upset to find they had run out of pineapple juice. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Well fed, we took a taxi to the pier, had an adrenaline inducing fight to reach the actual ticket office, in which we were led away several times to private sellers offering double the price, and boarded our night ferry with relief. We were on the upper deck right by an open window (there's no glass so I don't know if it's called a window, it's a big gap half covered by a tarp that lets in the sea breeze) and so I was happy. Happy in the way that I didn't feel my life was in immediate danger, it really took some convincing from Alex for me to agree to the night ferry, but then I was imagining being holed up in the underbelly of a ship with no escape, the reality was far better even if the bunk bed was rock solid.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Siargao\Sleeper Boat.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The boat took 2 hours longer than expected, we both slept intermittently and more than half the journey was spent in a thunderstorm.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="145">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 06-06-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our plan for today had been to book a Canyoneering tour to Kawasan Falls but for some undisclosed reason it was shut. We were disappointed but figured we'll have other opportunities elsewhere and so we hired a bike, took it for a quick spin over to Shaka for smoothie bowls and then went to explore waterfalls on our own adventure. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Moalboal\Bike.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Moalboal\Bowl2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We ended up at Cambais Falls after driving 30 minutes up through the beautiful tropical hills of Badian, which easily rivalled Vietnam on natural beauty. The final few kilometres we had to reach on foot, along a very obscure path that had us crossing the stream several times before it amassed to a beautiful tiered waterfall. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Moalboal\Waterfall1.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The only other visitors were a handful of locals with their children playing in the first pool; after they left we had the entire waterfall to ourselves. We fumbled over rocks taking pictures and Alex found a few good spots to jump from (although I didn't have the nerve to join him) we also spotted a solitary snake and magenta coloured dragonflies! It was incredible and I only minded the cold water a little. We left as it began to rain and found our scooter covered by cardboard by the locals to keep the seats dry! </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Moalboal\Waterfall2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Moalboal\Waterfall3.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to Jollibee again on the way home and severely underestimated the size of a family portion of Spaghetti as it came in a kilogram tupperware, leaving it to my glorified hoover of a boyfriend to finish the lot, I was happy with my pineapple juice. Then I fell into a coma life nap for a few hours and woke up for a late night Burrito run which did not disappoint.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="144">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="moalboal"> 05-06-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">The day started splendidly with a beautifully colourful smoothie bowl from Shaka. Alex was begrudging the cost until he tried his and enjoyed it possibly more than I did. In fact he enjoyed it so much that he even ate the straw from the coffee, declaring 'is this organic' in his best Morty voice and chomping off the end. It definitely wasn't meant to be eaten but he insisted.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Moalboal\Bowl1.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Pumped and raring to go, we went down to the beach in anticipation of the 'Sardine run' where millions of sardines gather just off Panagsama beach. They were absolutely no trouble to find and were truly incredible to see, however they were a little harder to catch on our camera as one swipe through the water towards them sent a ripple through their ranks, Alex has the best video where we swam down deep enough amongst them that they ended up encircling him in every direction. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Looking down from the surface they were only distinguishable by the shimmer of a few as they caught the light in just the right way to appear like quicksilver. When you get closer you can see distinct pathways created as though they swim in unseen channels, and their numbers seem endless. We also saw two turtles, one of which we had the opportunity to swim alongside as it peaked its cute little bald head above the surface. I saw 3 stunning lionfish together and the coral was fantastic with an almost completely vertical drop edge which was so much fun to swim down. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I'm trying my best at free diving and it feels like I'm improving rapidly. 2 days ago I couldn't pop my ears at all going down and today it was no trouble! My swimming is finally in time and Alex is happy with my entrance into the water. It's so thrilling, I experienced for the first time, but only once, the feeling of my diaphragm hammering like a bird trying to escape a cage as I held my breath calmly, it was probably the longest time I've ever spent ascending. Alex had a little trouble equalising and was getting really frustrated but he managed to clear his throat and was back to peak performance, catching the attention of a few Floridians who were scared to lose sight of him as he descended down the coral cliff. He has definitely earned bragging rights, next I want to hire flippers and see how deep he can really go but we'll need a dive case for the camera first as even today he exceeded the limit. We were in the water for over 3 hours without taking a break and finally put the camera to good use.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Exhausted, we got out before nightfall and dragged ourselves up the road for burritos and beer. Then we plodded home in the dark and drinking more beer proudly reviewed our footage.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Moalboal\Beer.jpg" alt="meh">
						</div>
						
						<div id="143">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 04-06-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Improvements have been made to our dreadful travel days, Alex has agreed to prioritise food. Before we even packed I had us down at the little hut place for toasties and smoothies. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got ready and were at the port promptly for the 11am boat, too punctually as we had to sit and wait for more people during which time Alex made friends with an Enzo-esque dog that after receiving a head scratch wouldn't leave his side. It was all very sweet, I took pictures, yes yes 'awe' 'so cute' until it caught the attention of a rival dog that sauntered over and without missing a beat cocked up a leg and peed right on my bag!</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Malapascua\Dog.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">I was dumbfounded. Realising too late I kicked my bag away and stood frozen in place. Naturally this was the same moment the guy came to tell us the boat was ready. Alex swooped up both my bags and was down on the beach rinsing them as best he could before I had a chance to cry. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The boat was smoother but the 7 hour bus to Cebu was awful and I didn't touch either bag the entire time. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Before our final 4 hour bus to Moalboal, we stopped off at the Philippine renowned Jollibee's fast food restaurant. We had sweet spaghetti, burgers and a tuna pie that was almost identical to the McDonald's apple pie in all but filling. The unusually sweet food sort of worked until it came to the burgers, then it really didn't work and we were both a bit disgusted.  The pineapple juice, soda floats and ice cream sundae made up for the faltering experience, and the chocolate sauce on the soft serve was the best I've ever had.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Moalboal\Jollibee.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Another bus and then a tricycle ride later and we checked-in to a wonderfully cool room with air conditioning and a toilet that flushes. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="142">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 03-06-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">I spent the entire night haunting our room like a restless ghost, I didn't sleep a wink it was so humid. I sat outside listening to the Cockerel's rise like werewolf to the full moon making a racket. Once the night reached daybreak the flies came for their breakfast and so I had to reluctantly return to the room and wait patiently for Sleeping Beauty to wake up. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had a much better time swimming than yesterday at the beach. We walked to a secret private beach that Alex had seen a dive site very close to. The way we walked to get there was through thick foliage, up a steep disconnected part of cracked road and quickly through the garden of a very fancy holiday villa; it felt very rogue. The beach was small and tucked behind a series of derelict villas which once might have been lovely. We put our beach bag down on the sand next to the private property sign. Alex was really excited and wasted no time wading in as we could see dive boats with scuba divers less than 100 meters offshore. Visibility was incredible and we spent hours diving down and looking at coral. Sadly there weren't an awful lot of fish, a mystery quickly solved when the dive boats left and the local fishing boats swooped in. The Nemos seemed far enough out to be safe though. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Malapascua\Water.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Malapascua\Private.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">A couple turned up on the beach whilst we were swimming and after I'd dried off and poked my head around the crumbling buildings they were ready to leave, we watched the way they walked and lo and behold, there was a much easier way to reach the beach. We followed them up some stairs and down a hill to arrive at the end of Long Beach. No bramble or trespassing necessary!</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We treated ourselves to pizza (again) for dinner, a well earned meal after all our free diving. It was perfectly filling and sufficiently cheesy. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="141">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 02-06-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We finally woke up to something resembling paradise and Alex has done nothing but complain about being too hot!</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Breakfast was a feast of pancakes, toasties and banana smoothies which I enjoyed thoroughly in the absence of nearly all the flies. Even the mosquitos can appreciate a sunny day but not my boy, whose sandals had rubbed the skin clean off his feet yesterday and woke up choosing war.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex pitifully shuffled his way to the closest beach and was sourly disappointed by the hoards of boats and the kelp garden growing as thick as grass only 10 meters out into the water. He ended up swimming through it but I refused after spotting a camouflaged jellyfish peeking out between the green. I lay in the shade reading and he came back after only 20 minutes complaining that the water stayed shallow and there wasn't anything to see. We walked the full length of the beach but nowhere seemed much improved and Alex was intolerably hot and irritated. We argued half heartedly but gave up and went together to bob around in the shallow water to cool tempers. 5 minutes after we walked back to our room it started showering. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">With the air feeling now slightly less humid we treated ourselves to pizza which was deliciously cheesy and then we watched cloudy with a chance of meatballs in bed. Such an underrated film. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We both woke up when the power went out and our feeble little fan became a decoration in our room that was quickly becoming hot enough to melt diamonds. It was unbearable. An hour later and with it turned back on whizzing around as best it can (nothing compared to air-conditioning) we got up and commenced the watching of grey, dismal rain. We had another miserable lunch batting flies and sulked back to our room which is where our host found us. She came to deliver a toilet seat for our room, what a treat! It must have been obvious we needed something to do because she recommended that we go to North Beach, which we begrudgingly did. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The walk from either end of the island only takes 30 minutes but most of the paths are made from shuffling feet and pass through people's gardens. Muddy puddles were unavoidable. The island appears to be a jumbled mix of locals with tourists sprinkled in between. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Malapascua\Beach.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">At the beach we swam in the light dregs of the storm, now only a drizzle, and saw coral, huge starfish and black jellyfish. We also spotted a mystery blue creature with more arms than a regular starfish. There was lots to see and the water was super clear. We spent the good part of 2 hours without coming back in and were the only people on the entire beach besides stray dogs and one man with a foam board. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Malapascua\Shell.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The walk back was accompanied by more 'hellos' and 3 boys on a scooter that said they loved me.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">I'm moody because I'm covered in bites and I'm only now realising it’s rainy season. We waited for enough people to fill up the boat and then we were off to Malapascua. The water was super choppy and people looked worried but the seamen kept laughing and assuring it was normal, naturally it rained again and so we had to throw our bags under cover and accept that everything else was getting wet. Alex spent the hour-long journey speaking to a laid back middle aged Aussie who told him about tomato farming and not wearing shoes anymore. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We washed up on the beach because the waves were too big at the pier and then we stood stranded with our bags having no idea where the airbnb was and without any data to message our host who was supposed to meet us at the jetty. Eventually, with help from the locals, we contacted our host who sent her son out of school to find us. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went out for lunch and had garlic <i>on</i> bread, and that <i>on</i> really makes the difference. The rest of our meal was okay but I was so preoccupied with batting away flies that I didn't enjoy it much. Then we slugged around the island in nothing but rain storms and became absolutely drenched and miserable. We stood undercover whilst Alex figured out the way back as school finished and kids poured out en masse. Self consciously we waited and had every single kid say hello to us. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Malapascua\Rain.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">In our room we dried off and watched the endless onslaught of rain until we went to bed.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="cebu"> 30-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were up at 8.30am with bloodshot eyes in preparation for a day's travel. We bought a 75p sim card for my phone which unsurprisingly isn't working and Alex made me force a shawarma wrap down my throat at 9am because he didn't want me complaining later of being hungry. We were off to a bad start, then our next host rang to let us know that due to a weather warning all boats to and from Malapascua are cancelled for the day. We had to push back both our reservations and book somewhere last minute by the port for tonight.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Still we decided to make the 5hr journey up from Cebu to Maya. First impressions of the Philippines are positive, everyone we've come across so far has been really nice, lots of smiles and friendly hellos. English appears to be widely spoken too which makes so many things easier. People look attractive and friendly, speaking in bubbly round accents.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Cebu\Sleepy.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">From the bus we walked 15 minutes to find our airbnb and were greeted by the entire town. It was just a coincidence I'm sure, but everyone was out and waving, it's only a small fishing village by the port so I guess visitors are somewhat rare. Our house for the night is entirely made from bamboo with 2 stories, a kitchen, porch and garden leading into the sea. It was very cool and had me living my 'blue lagoon' fantasy although unfortunately I don't look like Brooke Shields.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Malapascua\Hut.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Malapascua\Garden.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Our host came to greet us, and chastise us for not switching on any of the lights, we sat outside in the garden chatting and then he offered to take Alex out to pick up a takeaway. They went, I waited, saw the notification come through on my banking app that Alex had withdrawn over £100 and then waited some more. It was 45 minutes and they still hadn't come back and then I started to think, what if Alex was at knife point withdrawing money, he doesn't have a sim card or any way of getting help, how long would I sit idle and wait? What would I do if I did decide to act? Anyhow he came back with noodles and onion rings so it was all fine in the end, our host remains a safe, kind person and we enjoyed our food.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex had a giant ugly flying beetle land on his naked back, understandably he freaked out and launched it off the balcony only for it to return! He whipped out the bug spray and absolutely annihilated it, it was awful there was a black smear left across the floor as it withered and died. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">I think i've given myself whiplash this morning from flinching when a flock of pigeons took off right by my head as we walked past. My neck really hurts. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It's taken until our final bus in Korea to witness somebody else get more stared at than us. There was a woman sitting at the back of the bus, presumably having an argument, very loudly over the phone. Even the driver was staring at her, I don't know how she wasn't self conscious it was social suicide.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Sunset.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We arrived at the airport in the nick of time: 6 hours before take off. It should have felt longer but the time passed fine, probably because we had good food. Before check in we had Dunkin Donuts and then after security we found a Lotteria, very similar to McDonald's but more reasonably priced. Getting on a plane with a full belly is a game changer! Super satisfied and meant we didn't have to scrounge around looking for a quick meal once we landed, we took a taxi straight to our airbnb at 2am and went to sleep, which is definitely for the best as our room looks like a prison cell.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 28-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Woke up to a scary warning on my phone, which when translated was a weather alert. Seems a bit extreme but the rain has persisted. As it is our last full day we grumpily put on our raincoats and agreed to forcefully enjoy Seoul one last time, and we really did try but the city seemed hell bent on showing us the worst. Everywhere we went looked dull and drizzly. We visited the Palace, then walked around getting lost in an area that looked like Manchester with a 5 o'clock shadow. The market was mostly closed with tarps flying in the wind and the underground train stations were filled with more homeless people than I've ever seen in one place. The whole scene was depressing and my raincoat continues to act only for show and let water seep in down my neck. The ride home had our coats drying under needless air-conditioning that made us shiver. Too miserable to search for other options we again x3 had Mom's Touch. We frog marched home as quickly as possible, breaking into a self-conscious half run for the final stretch and throwing our wet clothes on the floor and jumping straight into bed, eating burgers and boneless crispy fried chicken in soy garlic sauce, the best we've had yet. One might even say it was finger licking good.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 27-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">It rained all day and so we just didn't leave. Instead our day can be distinguished in two halves. The first half where we argued and I stormed out only to walk 10 meters down the road, and then came straight back to cry my makeup off. The second half where we made up, were extra sweet on each other and played games. We have just booked somewhere for the Philippines that doesn't have a shower and so it doesn't feel wrong to make the most of our comforts whilst we still have them.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I think today's highlight was realising our juice from the supermarket is Jeju mandarin juice! So we did get to try it after all, just a little further away from the source. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="134">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 26-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Woke up feeling like I'd been hit by a moving truck. Neither of us had any motivation to go anywhere and so we stayed in, resumed our rummikub tournament and watched Netflix. In the evening we went to the supermarket for more provisions, namely tuna to make more toasties and I found Lay's Salt and Vinegar crisps! Absolutely overjoyed. I've been searching since Thailand, they were so expensive you could almost quantify the cost per crisp but some things in life are worth more than money. I put them out in a bowl to pick at between bites of my toastie and had a raving time. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Crisps.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Walking back from the shop we decided to pick up a few beers and so Alex left me sat outside on a bench with our shopping whilst he nipped in, left alone less than 5 minutes and I hear a nervous 'Hi' from behind me. I turn around and there's a man half bent over staring at me, I say hi back to which he giggles and then Alex comes out the shop and the man, still giggling, scurries off. It was so strange. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">That's it for today, my only regret was not buying 2 packs of crisps instead of 1.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="133">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 25-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We both ate a jumbo breakfast consisting of everything we have: Pancakes, toast, noodles and Nutella galore. That was the extent of preparation we made for today's big hike up Baegundae Peak, 836 meters.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">But first we had to make the cursed journey into Seoul, to which Alex is getting increasingly frustrated with. The stations are confusing, not intuitive or well signed. I also thought for a second he was going to square up to an old woman on the train with eyes like saucers, so maybe patience is wearing thin all over. After the train we rode on a bus for 45 minutes, giving us a total all round commute of 5 hours. There really is a lot to wear us down here but we're actually holding up okay. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Arriving at Bukhansan national park we began our ascent and picked the harder, shorter route up to the top. Two friendly men 10 minutes into our climb met us on their way down and said we wouldn't make it before dark. I don't know if they were being serious or just teasing us but it sent Alex into a 'I'll prove them wrong' frenzy, doubling up the pace and accusing me of not trying! </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Concrete.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">He was so hard on me, it wasn't until I threw a paddy that he admitted to trying 'tough love' because it worked on Jesse in Breaking Bad! No surprise I made him change his tune and I received 'you're doing well' and 'keep going baby' all the way up to the top. It was grueling though, even when it got exciting and we were pulling ourselves up slabs of rock and <i>scrambling</i>.The summit was an incredible 360 view of the entire city. So many of the high rise apartments were identical to each other that they looked like a glitch in the matrix.  </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Summit1.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Summit2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Technically we saw mountain cats. These soft looking kittens live up near the peak and act domesticated but speaking to a man briefly he said they are in fact wild and have slyly adapted to humans in exchange for packed lunches. Seeing people tucking into their sandwiches drove me crazy, I swear I'm bringing snacks to our next hike. We got our pictures with the flag and then slipped and slided our way down successfully before it got dark.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Cats.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex killed a fly with his eyelid which was disgustingly skilled and then with ravenous appetites and shaking legs we went to Sinchon only to find our Tonkotsu place shut and the cheap Korean bbq fully booked, disappointed and too hungry to care we ended up in Mom's Touch again to devour chicken burgers. Sinchon at night was even more lively and upbeat than in the daytime.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 24-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We get stared at from the moment we leave the flat, and we're both getting tired of it. Alex notices more than I do but sometimes it's so brazen that the people don't even care if you stare back, we've come to the conclusion that because kids don't look it means we're nothing new, and the people don't smile so we have to assume it's judgemental or hostile.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Lanterns.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Anyway we mustered up the confidence to explore another part of Seoul, starting with the Bukchon Hanok Village. It was nice to walk around the 15th century street, although a little bit strange since they are still people's houses you're mooching around. We saw a lot of people dressed up in traditional outfits, girls in Hanboks and men in their baji (trousers) and jeogori (upper garment). I posed the idea to Alex but I think even I would have been too scared, nevermind trying to wrestle him into the tall hats.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Hanok.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Tonkotsu.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">For lunch we went to Sinchon which was noticeably a student area. We ate Tonkotsu which was crispy, hot and I think the cheapest meal you can find in the whole of Seoul. Then we walked from Sinchon to Hongdae which was again lively and full of young people. We were starting to believe the average age of people living in Seoul was over 70 but I think today might have evened out the numbers a bit. We sat down for the most aesthetic and expensive milk tea I've had yet. Then we walked through all the trendy shops and bars until we reached the river. We found the most urban-core park to ever exist, it was dismal. Even the garden sized patch of grass wasn't an inch thick, not that people really walk their dogs here. It's more common to see a dog being carried or pushed around in a baby stroller than using any of its 4 legs. On that note we rode the train back and bulked up on instant noodles.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 23-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Today we went to the beach in Incheon. The weather was nice and honestly, we still didn't feel like tackling Seoul. It was a 4 hour round trip but we did get to ride on a driverless train and stand at the front staring down into the dim tunnel, and we also drove around the airport which was rated the best airport in the world for a while and so you bet the planes were exciting enough for Alex. There wasn't much else around in terms of buildings and so you could see the planes coming in from really far away. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Driverless.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Eurwangni beach was strikingly standard. We put our towel down and got out our books and I really sat there trying to think of a single thing to point out but there was nothing. Standard sand, standard shore, standard water. Evoking absolutely no particular feeling, I suppose it is special exactly for that reason, I can't think of a single other beach that is so void of personality. Even Formby beach I would describe as coarse and broody, and the sand dunes are great! We had planned to stay for sunset but facing the wind it was actually rather cold and the sun didn't go down until 7.45pm.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Beach.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We waited until we were back to cook dinner again, our spending for the month better appreciate the efforts we’re making to save! We’re eating enough noodles to risk becoming one.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="130">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="may-week4"> 22-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Morning included the second half of the pancake batter and then we decided to explore Incheon with the idea that it would hopefully be less overwhelming, although Incheon is still the 3rd largest city in Korea.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Back on the train for a journey that wasn't actually that much shorter than going into Seoul, we went to Chinatown and walked up a bunch of stairs that would supposedly bring us good fortune, and looked at some more stairs that represented the old Chinese, Japanese border that existed in 1875. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Chinatown.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Lamp.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we enjoyed a milk tea and eyed up some dumplings that we decided were too expensive. Only slightly hungry we walked around the historical open port area full of different style buildings and then made our way to central park, there we walked along the river and looked at the Hanok Village, where the 'west meets the east' with the beautiful oriental building sitting in contrast to the high rise buildings across the water. It's a shame, originally the complex was built for people to experience traditional culture but it has instead been leased to fine dining restaurants and a hotel. The location is used regularly for filming though which is exciting. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Central Park.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Chinese.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">On the way back we made another trip to the supermarket and nearly ran home we were that excited. We have tuna, mayo and cheese, for toasties! The pressure was on, Alex dutifully took on the task and delivered quite possibly the best tuna melt toastie to ever exist. Better than any we had in Taiwan, this one tasted like home. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="129">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 21-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex gave me his nonsense birthday card that he had picked up in Taiwan 'Many happy for you, returns of the day' then i blew out the candle on my cake, and Alex got to making pancakes. I'll give Alex the credit but it might have just been a superior pancake mix, every one of the pancakes came out fluffy and soft, I added just a touch of nutella to the pancakes and took advantage of Alex's amiability for today and licked nutella straight off the spoon exactly how he hates. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Cake.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Cooking.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then I wore my present from Alex, the dress I had tailor made in HoiAn, which feels like an eternity ago, and we went to Myeongdong Street, dubbed the 'mecca' of shopping. I got birthday milk tea (Anything I do today will be preceded by 'birthday' so to feel special) and then I went to all the shops I'd only ever heard about like the pink Stylenanda hotel and Etude House, and Olive Young which stocked practically everything. I am so pleased with my little haul, Alex patiently helped me decide on my foundation colour and which slightly different colour of glitter to buy, I am super excited to try out the glitters I bought! </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Bubble Tea.jpg" alt="meh">

							<p class="diary-entries">Every shop was girly, bright and oh so enticing. I was relieved from the ever looming budget with birthday money and so it really was a girly and bright dream. The Lady in Tony Moly tried to hard sell me anti ageing snail gold cream and midway through spiel asked if I was at least 18. Relieved to know I don't need to worry about anti ageing creams just yet, however it did mean she didn't get the sale she was after.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Makeup.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Pink.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Things went slowly down hill after shopping as without google maps or reliable wifi we felt lost and aimless. With prices very similar to home we couldn't exactly waltz into any restaurant that smelt nice and so we searched about for somewhere cheap, settled on sharing a curry and somewhat dejectedly headed back. The journey took almost 2 hours and had us both nodding off, and so we arrived back at our homely flat feeling hungry and groggy. Morale was low, we'd thrown ourselves into the busiest district Seoul had to offer and left overwhelmed and scared, albeit with nice makeup. But all's well that ends well, I had Alex go out and pick up chicken, beer and soju and we had ourselves a cosy night in playing games and listening to kpop. Alex passed out first at the other end of the bed, and so very sweetly, on my 23rd birthday, I slept in a bed only slightly larger than a single, with my boyfriend, top to tail. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="seoul"> 20-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got to the airport in the morning and had a great view of the runway but Alex barely paid attention because the planes were only the boring ones. I still watched. Then we nearly missed our flight, it wasn't until the final call for boarding that we realised it was our flight ready to go. Then we had a super quick 1hr flight to Seoul and then a not so quick train journey to Incheon to our airbnb. We're staying in the cutest tiny flat ever, there's a kitchen and full sized fridge, washing machine, ensuite and even a desk. If there's no hidden cameras then we really have struck lucky.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">For dinner we went out to Koreans no.1 chicken sandwich joint, Mom's touch. We blindly pointed at the meal for 2 and patiently waited. For fast food the service was not very fast but the 2 burgers, fries and box of fried chicken and tteokbokki that arrived was worth the wait. It beats KFC everyday on all bases. Best chicken burger either of us has ever had.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Seoul\Moms.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we dipped into a bakery and picked up a birthday cake for tomorrow with a cute heart candle. Final stop for the night was the supermarket so that we could make use of our first kitchen in 4 months. I also got some birthday treats like my favourite crisps and mint oreos. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="127">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 19-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">The weather was much clearer today and Alex had wanted to climb up Hallasan, Korea's tallest mountain, but it would be no easy feat taking approximately 10 hours and I still wasn't feeling great with stomach cramps and a headache so we settled on a forest walk instead. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Lunch was a big bowl of kimbap, tofu, boiled eggs, tteokbokki and some other undistinguishable things all stirred up in sauce. Alex really enjoyed it, I thought the flavour got boring very quickly but it was again great value and like nothing else we'd previously had. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Jeju\Saucy.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we took the bus to Saryeoni forest for a walk that became 10km long. It was beautiful, the path was wide and flat but the Japanese cedars were dense and tall, only allowing sunlight to filter down through the top leaves. We saw a few wild deer, but none of the *dangerous* dogs or boars. The route wasn't at all clear, although Alex maintains that an entire path has been wiped off the map (I think it's more likely that he got confused) After 5km we ended up just turning around and walking back because Alex was getting worried about sunset and not being able to catch the same bus from a different spot. I HATE turning around and walking back the way we came. </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Jeju\Forest2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We bought the Korean version of the easy card we had in Taiwan for the buses and trains and I've got to say, Korea wins this one, just look how adorable these are! </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Jeju\Tmoney.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Back on the same bus we went to Dongmun Market which was smaller than the ones we have gotten used to, and much louder. I wanted to go solely for the orange juice that Jeju is famous for, it was being sold everywhere along with crates of oranges and every type of themed souvenir. Typically I accidentally picked up mango juice. It felt symbolic of how our day had gone and so dejected I refused to buy more juice and sulked around until Alex found a jumbo slab of honey cake twice the size of the loaves we were buying in Taipei. We took our prize home and topped up our bellies with more instant noodles. We both fell asleep on the bus back to our hostel. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Our big window announced the weather forecast, rain all day. We made breakfast in the kitchen with our rations of bread, an egg and a square of fake cheese then we got back into bed to contemplate our next move. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We eventually decided to ignore the rain and go for a walk. 3 minutes into the walk I discovered that I had in fact washed off the waterproofing from my coat when I cleaned it back in Cambodia, so I was soaking very quickly. It felt like English rain; constant and cold. Our miserable walk climaxed in a waterfall which was very pretty and then we opted to not do anything else cold and wet so we stopped off at 7/11 again and bought noodles, my favourite korean crisps and more grape sweets. Then we jumped into bed, opened the window to better hear the rain and cuddled up to watch Breaking Bad. I wasn't feeling well and slept from mid afternoon until the evening, waking up in time to say goodnight to Alex and go back to sleep.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Steven is lovely and I really wouldn't want to say anything against him but he drives like a race car driver in his heyday, it is terrifying. The roads are so winding and he throws his car into corners like an absolute maniac with his whole body. The first lift he gave us we nearly hit a stationary taxi that was at the bottom of a hill but today we nearly hit a bus on the other side of the road which was so much worse. We were running late, Steven being the nice man he is, put a rush on which exacerbated the situation and had the car nearly lifting off, but god he did not see that bus until the last minute. Me and Alex were ready for final goodbyes and Steven continued on like nothing had happened, close calls all the way. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">He dropped us off with a new appreciation for life and we got on our shuttle to the airport.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Mixed feelings, sad to leave but then very excited for Korea. Alex said I'm dressed like a Sunflower in my green pants and his yellow jumper. I think he meant it as a compliment but does anyone really want to look like a bright obnoxious flower?</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The airport was so strange, all the shops were luxury, no tacky souvenirs to browse or overpriced sandwiches, and all the windows were blocked. We searched the entire airport and the best view we could find was half a window in a cafe, but it was a nice excuse to share an orange juice. The ground crew waved as our plane took off which was super cute and made us even more sad to leave. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The flight felt even shorter than it was and we were able to get on the airport shuttle to our hostel easy enough. Our room has a big window, a lovely comfy bed and more importantly, felt clean. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Jeju\Hostel.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We had a monumental first meal in Korea. Alex gets all the credit for finding the place on Kakao maps. We didn't even need to struggle through ordering food as there are only 2 options, squid or black pork Duruchigi. We both agree it is one of the best meals we've had since travelling, it was also completely different from anything else we've eaten. The guy pretty much did everything for us, frying up the pork and adding the big pile of vegetables. I had my first bite of certifiably authentic kimchi which made me so happy I could cry. The food was so yummy, the veg all had a satisfying crunch like bean sprouts, and the pork was delicious. We started copying the guy sitting on the table behind and wrapped bite sized amounts in lettuce leaves which made so much sense. We finished everything in record speed, even throwing in the remaining rice to soak up the sauce left at the bottom of the pan. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Jeju\Lettuce.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we went to check out the 7/11 and got an ice cream each. I also bought a pack of my favourite grape sweets not knowing I would have to share them with Alex.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 16-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">The weather is absolutely glorious, fresh air and clear skies. We've decided my bag is too full and too heavy with things I don't need and so after sending our cheapest postcard home for 30p we've decided now would probably be the best time to shed some weight. I've sent home a parcel with my thick pants and jumper, and few tops that I like but don't wear. I can't wait to completely revise my bag for Australia. Now I'm 2kg's down with space to spare! However Alex has put his foot down and told me that space is not an opportunity for shopping. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After the post office we had our final brunch which felt so sad. I obviously had to get a tuna toastie which was a  delicious doorstop, Alex had an equally scrumptious bagel, both washed down with milk tea. Then Alex went rogue again and ordered a Hong Kong carrot cake, emphasis on the 'Hong Kong' because it was in no way a cake and we were very confused. It was a sort of glutinous rice thing with hoisin sauce, tasty but in no way what was expected.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Carrot Cake.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Sanwich.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The bus took us the wrong way and we missed our transfer bus, which meant it would take us another 2 hours to reach Pingxi where we planned to go on a hike. The day was only getting hotter and we didn't even know how long the hike would take and so reluctantly we gave up on the plan and pinned it on the map for something to definitely do 'next time' whenever that may be. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Instead we went on the cable cart that the bus had conveniently left us by. Called the Maokong Gondola, it stretches 4km with beautiful green views with Taipei stretching out in the North. It was a relaxing journey that took 20 minutes and felt like the perfect way to say goodbye. Taipei looked expansive, far bigger than it ever felt. Taipei 101 stood alone and green hills were scattered among the buildings, pushing up and fighting for space. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Cabel1.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Cabel2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We got off at the end, walked around for a little bit through farms and small fields and then hopped back on for the ride back. In town we went to the largest bookshop in Taipei which, like Vietnam, seemed to have all of their nicest copies not in English. Their English section was big but so dull and uninspiring after fawning over the detailed and vivid Chinese books. Then we went back through the local market to the small noodle place. The meal was good but not quite as fulfilling as the first time we visited, Alex chose Beef noodle soup which feels like the perfect way to pay homage. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We strolled through the shopping district after sunset and enjoyed a final milk tea. It feels like we've stayed here so much longer than 17 days, which is already so much longer than we planned, and we still didn't have time to do half the things we wanted, most days we just wanted to explore on our own and experience the day to day city, pretending like we belonged and had always been there. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="123">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 15-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Steven recommended we visit the Wulai Scenic Area, and so that's where our day took us. The weather was clear and sunny.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Milk Tea.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We arrived, I had my brown sugar milk tea, and then we hopped on a ridiculous toy train that nearly fell onto its side going round corners. We saw a taiwan Blue Magpie, that we mistook at first for a parrot, and we visited a waterfall. The layout was nice, a town on one side, then a deep valley on the left with a completely green side. We started walking, Alex seemed confident so we didn't look for any of the paths or trails, a big mistake as Alex ended up walking us uphill and along the road the entire time. He caught a caterpillar, we walked into countless spider webs and by the time we gave up we had seen only one particularly nice view point and felt paranoid that we were covered in bugs. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Waterfall.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Caterpillar.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">I'll mark some of the trails I later found on my map for when we return because some of them looked really off-road and fun. We are already planning what activities and places we will have to save for when we come back to Taiwan. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Hill.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Dinner was a quirky little place famous for their shaved ice dessert. The menu was small with only 3 pasta options, Alex discovered that green pasta was not pesto. We don't know what it was but the green was not caused by any vegetable, my white sauce pasta was fine, we were both really hungry so ate fast enough to not taste much. The dessert was super fun, I chose milk tea and Alex had honey lemon, the dome of shaved ice was huge and we found little puddings in the centre! We also got extra sauce and boba to add. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Shaved Ice.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we got back and started a new Sims 3 with a family named after the countries we visited. Malaysia is the grandma, Thailand and Vietnam are the parents, and so far we have Laos and Taiwan as young adults, we're saving Cambodia and Korea for the children. We promise we're not stereotyping anyone.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="122">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 14-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Rainy day as an excuse to have another lazy Sunday. We went out in the early afternoon to stock up on cinnamon tear and share and honey cake. We hardly made it out of the shop before our fingers were sticky with frosting. Then we went to explore a different night market from the usual, Raohe. The train we were riding became swarmed by pants and blue polo's. Literally thousands of people poured down the stairs and onto either platform all dressed identically, it was surreal. Like most things, we once again had no idea what was going on, our best guess is a Mothers Day event.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The market was completely food orientated which suited us perfectly. I got my daily milk tea and Alex went rogue and had a panna cotta tea, which tasted like normal but instead of boba had an entire pudding thrown in. Then we treated ourselves to steak which was phenomenal. Alex even let me get an 8oz Sirloin whilst he settled for a rump. I am not too proud to admit, my opinion on steak has done a complete 180. I finally get it, steak is worth the hype. We also got free refills on black tea and corn soup. For dessert we shared a fried ice cream that was slightly misleading as the ice cream itself isn't exactly fried, but is instead sandwiched in a pocket of pastry that is. Still it was deliciously hot, cold and sweet.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 13-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Breakfast was a roaring success. 4 pieces of perfectly toasted toast to start the day. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Steven invited us to church tomorrow, but we plan to do literally anything else, I'm sure he can make our excuses to God. Today I have finally convinced, begged, and threatened Alex to go to the hairdressers. He distracted himself with happy thoughts about cars. Apparently nearly all of the cars here are Japanese or German, with the exception of Ford. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I want to add in a detail about the bin men here but I can't seem to weave it into any of my entries so I'm just going to shoehorn it in here. The bin man has an ice cream truck in fancy dress, the disguise is broken only by the melody that cheerfully plays out to announce his arrival, then just like kids on a summer day the residents are called from their homes with rubbish bags in tow. How strange is that!? Alex bet they now associate the tune with bad smells. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The hairdressers was only a small local one in Xindien. The lady was running a one man band but reviews looked good and prices were cheap, the two requirements Alex had set. He showed her a reference photo which she glanced over and then went at him with scissors. She brushed out all his curls, creating an unruly puff and hacked away I don't know how. I was preparing to deal with tears but in the end she did a great job. It was still a little frizzy but after he showered and let the curls form again I think it turned out really nice.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Forever jealous and hating to be left out I decided to spontaneously get a haircut too. I also blew the bank and went for a half head dye. I have been seeing people with the nicest dyed hair everywhere since coming to Taiwan, and whilst it might not be a practical decision I thought sod it! It'll only be so much more expensive at home. I did have to spend over an hour panicking as I sat with brown paste applied to my hair that looked neither like bleach or pink dye. Alex had gone back and left me, nobody spoke a lick of English and I was facing the consequences of my rash decisions, but by the time Alex rocked back up I was having it all blow dried and styled with the underside of my hair the colour of milk tea. It's not the pink I asked for, and like with Alex she took no notice of my reference photos but I'm really pleased. Best haircut I've ever had, and the bleached hair still feels healthy and soft.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Chair.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Haircut.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">To celebrate Alex amiably agreed to go into a photobooth with me, taking in our milk tea as props and wearing fun headbands. I think the photos are super cute. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Photobooth.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Selfie.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we had fried dumplings, another meal at the food court and went back. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Dumplings.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">It felt like we were in a Wes Anderson film marching down the road in our raincoats with an earphone each, so we got into bed with ice cream and watched Fantastic Mr Fox. It was a surprisingly good day.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="120">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 12-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Breakfast was ruined by Alex getting mard over melted butter on the microwave, but my toast still tasted amazing. I have 5 days to finish the jar of Nutella, challenge accepted! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Round 2 at the phone shop, sim card has been successfully acquired but not without difficulty. The clerk was confused by my passport, so got a colleague to ask for my ID, then she was confused again, had another colleague ask for the address of the homestay, which she was then surprised to receive in english...more confusion, another long pause....tadar! A sim card, then she charged us double which Alex was straight on to, more confusion. I think Taiwan has definitely been the biggest language barrier we've faced, but we got there in the end and everyone was all smiles and friendliness.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we were off on our way to our most anticipated destination, Jiufen, the town that allegedly inspired Spirited Away, with a stop off first to climb Teapot Mountain.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The roads were insane, our driver takes the award for tightest corners to successfully maneuver a full sized bus around, I've never seen anything like it, I think those giant domed mirrors on corners must have saved our life. It was so difficult to not follow the crowd and get off early at Jiufen after being teased with the most beautiful view; peeking over a temple to see the sea and jutting out land below but we stayed seated and road the bus the extra 10 minutes to the Trailhead for teapot mountain and I'm so glad we did. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It began with a tunnel much like the one at the start of Spirited Away, but rather than a bathhouse we were greeted with sprawling, untouched hills in every direction. It was breathtaking. It truly felt like we had been transported somewhere magical that existed in that moment only for us. I have never before felt energy from a place that is so tangible, the forested mountainscape had drawn in a breath to hold and stilled all noise. Time stopped in a way that felt peaceful and right. Sensing the change in the air we also slowed and became quiet. I don't want to sound overly romantic but I know without doubt that one spot, just after the tunnel before we began hiking up, will be my favourite place in the whole of our trip, as it is my favourite place from the whole of my life, and if anywhere was going to bring about a spiritual awakening it would be there. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Tunnel.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Teapot.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">When it was over, the mountain exhaled and we began to climb up with a fresh sea breeze at our back. It wasn't a tough climb and the weather was mild, just shy of 2,000 meters an Eva Air plane cut low across the sky in its landing path like a colossal mechanical bird. The clouds had already begun to creep in and so it came without warning with the sound of a ghost being chased out of a tunnel. Alex kept a keen eye out for more but none passed. The nearby town of Jinguashi was holding a larger Taoism parade similar to the one we saw yesterday in the market. Even from a distance, where the music was only a whisper echoed through the hills, we could still make out the sweeping Generals, sending shivers down our spines. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">At the summit we very proudly took pictures that did the view absolutely no justice and then we began the chaotic run down taking 2 steps at a time and taking an 'out of bounds' shortcut down some stairs that were closed for maintenance. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Rock1.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Rock2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We walked to Jiufen the craziest way possible, walking uphill only to go downhill minutes later, through overgrown paths and forgotten stone stairs, we didn't cross a single other person and went the wrong way several times. We also saw signs warning against snakes and wasps. A small, intentional detour we made was to see the cemetery. Similar in style to the ones we rode past in Vietnam, these ones were tiled and each sat embedded in the mountain at different heights, rising almost completely vertically. I couldn't imagine a better view to overlook for eternity.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Forbidden.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Snake and Bee.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">In Jiufen we went to a traditional teahouse, supposedly *the teahouse* that inspired Hayao Miyazaki, without realising it was a set menu for £8 each. By far our most expensive meal here and to add insult to injury, there was no meal, only bite sized desserts. Alex was surprisingly good humoured about it, making sure to get every penny out of the experience nibbling away at crumbs and pouring the 5 pots of tea you can strain per portion of tea leaves, equating roughly to 75 small cups of oolong tea drank. He really took control of the tea making and started to come into his own, commenting on strength and colour with some vivacity. There was a whole ceremony to the tea, washing, pouring, sniffing tiny cups, I don't know, when the lady was demonstrating we were still processing the daylight robbery and there were too many similar steps. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Day Street.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Jiufen.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We were having fun mostly goofing around but then dusk started to fall and the clouds fell down from the mountain and began seeping in between the buildings. The red lanterns took on a hazy light and the sound of rain added an auditory twinkle to the scene, it was so special. We watched in wonder as everything took on a new beauty under the mix of darkness and white fog. The bay was the first to become lost in the distance, then the bottom of the street, the building across, by the hour we could only see the ghost outline of buildings and the glowing red bulbs. It was so overwhelmingly Spirited Away, I couldn't have asked for more. We were so lucky to get a balcony seat with a completely perfect view. The couple to my left seemed annoyed by the lack of experience they received. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Tea House Day.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Tea House Night2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The light drizzle gained some confidence and by the time Alex had finished pouring the last batch of our tea into his water bottle (we had to accept defeat, with bladders bursting it would be impossible for anyone to drink all the tea on offer, but we certainly weren't going to leave it either) the rain was falling heavy. We ran out, took the photos of the teahouse from across the street and then sprinted down the lantern lit roads laughing and ducking in and out of small pockets of shelter. We made it to the bus stop right on time to be turned away, the bus was full. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Tea House Night3.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Tea House Night1.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We sat on the bench, listening to the rain with our heads growing heavy. The ride home took over an hour, at which point we only had energy for a quick meal and then bed.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="119">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 11-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Steven has offered to give us a lift into Taipei, he also gave Alex an egg. In the meantime we went for food with him at a local place, I was horrified that my noodles accidentally became seafood noodles but with frequent plate swapping with Alex the food disappeared and I didn't have to seem rude by not eating. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We initially thought Steven was going to drive us into the city because he was going shopping, but it actually turned out that he was taking us to the supermarket so we could buy food. I guess since we extended our stay he thought we should get some bits in. It was great! We bought bananas, orange juice, bread, butter and Nutella for breakfast, then we picked up cheetos, icecream, honey cake and a scrummy looking cinnamon roll in a loaf tin...in hindsight it wasn't very thought out or balanced. Our combined sweet tooth is out of control. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Shopping.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then he drove us into Taipei, dropped us off by the station and took our food shopping home! We insisted on going back with him to help put away the shopping but he refused. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our top priority was buying another sim card as we have already stayed longer than we had planned and so our sim card from the airport has run out, leaving us small and lost in a big place. It's scary how reliant you become on using the Internet. That being said, we'll have to cope for another day because the phone shop refused to sell us a sim without seeing our physical passport. Wasted journey we consoled ourselves with our cinnamon roll cake and a large milk tea with boba. The rise in blood sugar was almost auditory. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Then my spirit for a shopping spree quickly fizzled out as I worked out the prices, and after 3 multistory cosmetic stores I only timidly walked out with a pressed powder by Taiwanese brand 1028. It's good though, now I'll stop looking like a greased up pig ready for the oven every time I apply suncream to my face.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex realised he showered with shampoo and washed his hair with soap. He can't tell the difference which I think says something about the products. We still desperately need conditioner but with the impending weight limits on our bags it seems silly to add another bottle into the mix.  </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we went back to Shilin Market which was haunted by a terrifying parade. We had no idea what was going on but I don't think you can call it a celebration, there were these looming figures with swinging arms and scary little faces with people inside operating them. They walked single file accompanied by horrible tuneless noise. Alex said he felt so weird he might pass out which I presume is a man's way of expressing fear. I have since researched and found out that it was a Taoism ritual, the Holy Generals are police of the underworld and represent the order of heaven. Essentially they are supposed to be spooky in order to scare away any ghosts. Maybe they were short on ghosts that night and were trying to convert some of the audience. If the one in the front had turned around to face us suddenly like we thought he might, I think we would have died. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei2\Scary.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">On a happier note we tried the popular cheesy corn! Then we went to the same underground food court as last time and tried oyster omelette with peanut sauce which was strange and gooey but the flavour was really good and the food came out piping hot within minutes. I then very Impulsively spent £20 on bright lime green dungarees. A bizarre choice, I don't know what came over me but I love them. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex said Taipei felt bigger today. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="118">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="taipei2"> 10-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">My adoring boyfriend went out to pick up another of the best brown sugar milk teas for our sort of breakfast. We enjoyed it together on the bed after we had packed. Can you believe a litre of tea can still leave you wanting more? </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we walked the short distance to the train station and hopped easily onto the next train going to Taipei. Pipsy squeezy. Our host, Steven, who is at least 80 years old, came and picked us up from the station in his dinky blue Ford from the 90's. We seem to have accidentally landed ourselves in a genuine homestay. We're staying in Stevens House and it only took us 10 minutes to decide to extend our stay until our flights on the 17th. Honestly we didn't have an awful lot of choice as there was nowhere less than £40 a night within the Taipei metro lines. It's comfortable though, and only £10 a night with the small inconvenience of catching a bus before reaching the very end of the Green line. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Steven gave us melon, he's very sweet and, whilst his English is not great, is still managing to communicate well, all his children are accounted for and he has 2 grandchildren. His wife studied Physics and the Family Mart around the corner is 24/7. It's a real mix of necessity and conversation when it suits him. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I'm super excited to be back in Taipei tomorrow. Gonna get the fried dumplings from the night market and the tasty noodles from the grocery market, and surely a good brown sugar milk tea. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex crunched the numbers and spending is looking good. Disregarding the flights and across border buses, Taiwan has the lowest daily spend. I suppose it's a combination of a few factors, we're not doing much in terms of paid activities, and transport has been so cheap even for the longer journeys, we're also not moving around as quickly which I think is definitely the way we prefer to travel. Things are good.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="117">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 09-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Woke up predictably late and ate our 7/11 packed lunch unpacked at the table immediately outside the store, next to a drunk man passed out, which is a shame because last night we were applauding Taiwan for their lack of drinking culture and loud nightlife. Fun fact Taiwan has the lowest tolerance to alcohol in the world due to a deficiency in the enzyme ALDH2 which affects approximately 47% of the population and renders them unable to properly metabolise alcohol, so that explains some of it. Imagine cafe dates and night market snacking being the normal way to socialise, I think I'd fare a bit better and suffer far less. Anyhow back to my lunch because it needs to be noted, I bought sandwiches, an egg mayo and tuna mayo packaged together and both were superb. Better than any meal deal at home, the egg was still chunky and the mayo complimented rather than worked to disguise the flavours. Very scrummy, we also enjoyed more onigiri. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Almost missed the bus, again. Food made us distracted but we made it with a hop skip and a jump. Taroko was super busy today, we can't think why as it's only a Tuesday. Maybe all the tours run on a similar itinerary and we fell unlucky lining up with them. We got off at the Buluowan Suspension Bridge which is 153 metres above the Liwu Valley. It really gave an indication of size as despite the vantage point all we could see in either direction was a continuation of the valley, this gigantic impression of a snake cutting through the earth and leaving a twisting trail in its wake. Ancient and unyielding. The forest was also something new to admire. It looked far less tropical than what we typically saw in South East Asia, no palms or big leaves, but trees close together like overlapping umbrellas, a bit like how moss must look to an ant. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Hualien\Bridge.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Hualien\River.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Marvelled out we sat back at the bus stop ready to go on a longer walk that follows the bottom of the valley. Expecting to wait only 10 minutes we talked, browsed airbnb and checked reviews for places, and then 'where’s this bus?' </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After waiting 40 minutes we checked the board for the first time in what would become a series of anxious glances and saw all the buses except one were out of service. We translated what we could, hoped for a bus at half past the hour and waited another full hour.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hualien\Bus Stop.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">It becomes no longer busy…  A few times we felt relieved as other people appeared to be waiting with us, but everyone eventually piled onto tour buses. We stand alone. Nervously.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The bridge is closed. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The last of the tour buses are pulling away.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex's stress levels peak.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">He proposes we walk. Yesterday he called me a lunatic for suggesting we walk even a minute along the road and we had an argument over it! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We started to walk. Alex became a walking time bomb, only 1hr30 left of daylight. The dreaded 'don't linger' sign made another appearance and I nearly slipped walking downhill. The end was near, do we walk in the opposite direction to the town to the next bus stop, or spend our remaining energy trying to get back ourselves. In the end the bus showed its devilish face 5 minutes into our walk and we were able to flag it down. None of the other passengers looked phased. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We had no more time for a walk as our faith in the buses here expired. Dumplings were the natural progression. We got the same 2 types as both the days previous however we doubled up on the bao. 30 dumplings between 2 greedy mouths. Does a more fulfilling meal exist? We've eaten the same dinner for our entire time in Hualien because with a meal so hearty and delicious there is zero incentive to go elsewhere. It was *almost* transcendent however after 4 nights I still could not successfully get to grips with using the metal chopsticks. My conduct was clumsy and on more than one occasion I resorted to man handling the bao. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">For my separate dessert belly I had what I'm sure is actually the nicest brown sugar milk tea and it came in a litre jug too wide to fit my hand around.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After an hour or so winding down in our room, the now familiar sound of military jets passing low overhead erupted into a thunderous consumption of sound. Alex explained one of the aircraft must have cranked on the power early and used the opportunity to stand outside watching them, I assume hoping for another eruption.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="may-week2"> 08-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our morning started with chaos as we had to catch the bus to take us to Taroko Gorge. We read online that the bus stop was in front of an orange building and so rather than do the obvious thing and head directly to the bus station we searched around in a panic trying to find an elusive building that has since been demolished and replaced by said bus station. Already feeling like idiots, we then spoke to the woman at reception who said the next bus wouldn't be here for another 40 minutes and to get the train instead. At the train station we couldn't understand when the next train was and so confused and defeated we went for breakfast. I enjoyed yet another tuna toasty and then we nearly missed the bus again.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Taroko national park was as beautiful as expected and the air was so crisp. Unfortunately only the first 1km of the Baiyang Trail was open due to a landslide. An unsettling regular occurrence, there are signs everywhere to warn of falling rocks but the solution is to 'not linger' in those areas.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hualien\Sign.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We walked through a long and completely pitch dark tunnel and enjoyed the view from a platform. The park is enormous and so to visit the different trails you hop on and off the bus. Very convenient and as per for Taiwan, very reasonably priced. Next we went to the Tunnel of 9 Turns which offered incredible views of a waterfall and fast flowing river below. The gorge is a spectacle, formed by a combination of erosion and uplifting. We had to look all the way up to see the top, I'm so happy I remembered to bring my glasses!</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hualien\Tunnel.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Lunch was courtesy of 7/11 and was a successfully balanced meal: Banana, choco pie and Onigiri. The food was really good but I enjoyed the novelty of a packed lunch far more.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hualien\Gorge1.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we got back on the bus to visit the Changchun Shrine. The roads are not fun, they are steep and winding with terrifying drop offs but you just have to trust that the bus drivers are so experienced and probably know the roads like the back of their hands. All faith was immediately shattered as our bus driver destroyed his wing mirror on a bend passing another bus. He stopped, fiddled with it a bit, continued, stopped again, until we reached the Shrine and then we whipped out his trusty roll of sellotape (not even duct tape) and began his repair job. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hualien\Bus.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We then visited the Eternal Spring Shrine, which serves as a memorial for the 226 men that died constructing the Taroko highway in 1956. I guess it really is as dangerous as it looks. Being hit by falling rocks and slipping over cliff edges took the most lives. On a more upbeat note, the Shrine was beautiful with a waterfall running through its centre. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hualien\Gorge2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">With no other choice we rode the bus back, and took a well earned nap. Then we went out for dumplings again, they really are that nice, however Alex prefers the soy sauce mixed with garlic and now his breath is making me feel physically repulsed. I ordered another brown sugar milk tea from a teahouse except I forgot to ask for the boba. Very disappointing as boba creates enormous fun for Alex.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex K.O'ed me off the bed in our wrestle mania rehearsal. It got a bit too real and I needed to be rushed into medical to have my elbow kissed.</p>

						<div id="115">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 07-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We treated ourselves to an extremely lazy Sunday spent mostly tucked up in bed. Hualien seems much more tourist centric and so it worked out well to spend a quiet day together on the weekend. Tomorrow we will be up and ready to explore Taroko without the crowds.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We did a little bit of admin, finding places to stay and finalising our very last minute trip to Korea. We'll be missing our Indonesia but figure it's far more likely we'll find a chance to visit in the future than somewhere like Korea. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we went on a long walk to a small restaurant that sold renowned Coffin Bread. Apparently it used to be found only in the night market but the owner has successfully opened his own restaurant and business sure looked good. There was a constant slew of people lining up and delivery drivers on bikes waiting patiently for the one man to assemble and fry up endless amounts of coffin bread. It's essentially a scooped out thick slice of bread, fried and filled with meat with a lid placed back on top. I got honey chicken and Alex tried chicken curry, we also got free refills of iced tea which was a bonus. It was really tasty, if not a little difficult to eat.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hualien\Coffin.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we walked the long way to the beach. The water looked clear but with black sand and pebbles as the back drop it took on a steely colour that better suited its ferocity. The waves were relentless against the steep beach, and even more so against the huge rip raps that served as much needed armour. We danced across them until Alex got bored and started throwing pebbles into the sea, then he started affectionately throwing pebbles at me instead. He skimmed rocks in a calm estuary on its way to join the ocean and I watched with growing anxiety as dusk fell and the atmosphere turned creepy. There was nobody around and it felt like we had walked off the map in an open world RPG. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hualien\Sea.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">I steered us back and we walked through the night market but wasn't tempted by anything, then we eyed up the prices in Mc Donald's and decided to have the same dumplings as last night. I didn't appreciate them much the first time but tonight they were steaming hot, doughy and delicious.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I took a second to appreciate how special it really is to be eating dumplings in a small hole in the wall restaurant in Taiwan. I know it sounds like an unconventional moment to be grateful for but I'm just so happy to be here.</p>

						<div id="114">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="hualien"> 06-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">On the high speed rail which is basically a Japanese bullet train, for once not the cheapest option but because Alex wanted to. Can't skimp out on such an experience, after all it will be the fastest we've ever gone on land. I'm not about to complain however since the fast train is far more comfortable than the local train that we took down to Taichung. We're on our way to Hualien but because the island is so mountainous in the centre all the transport is coastal, meaning we had to go back through Taipei and catch another train to Hualien. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hualien\HSR.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Weekend holidayers meant the next train was fully booked, leaving us with 3 hours to kill in Nangang, the outskirts of Taipei. Refusing to slug our bags around we made camp in a small cafe that exclusively sold waffles and tea. Bizarrely the menu was still extensive with not all the waffles being sweet. Alex ordered a custard waffle, I however ordered a tuna crunch. Sounds weird, but I cannot express enough how nice it was. The waffle was light and crunchy, and the tuna was warm and slightly sweet, with sweetcorn and lettuce. After an hour of sitting around and being assaulted every 5 minutes with the sweet honey smell of freshly made waffles I gave in and ordered another. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hualien\Waffle.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we got another train that was only a few hours long but left us inexplicably tired. Alex found a place to eat that sold dumplings only 5 minutes away and wouldn't cost us more than £4. Google couldn't translate the majority of the menu but we got noodles and a set of gyoza's and bao buns. They were nice, we also popped into a sweet shop on our way back for a wee pick n mix, I got some jelly straws and Alex bagged himself some rhubarb and custard rings, then we went back and immediately slept.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 05-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Today we jumped on the bus to go just a little out of town to rent bicycles. There's a popular bike path that was originally a railway, now it's a completely off road and really scenic trail with trees on either side. We rode through an old railway tunnel and over gentle rolling hills, there were a lot of parents with their young kids on tandem bikes and it seemed like everyone except us were cheats and using electric bikes, even the tandems! There were also extra lazy people in golf buggies but overall it wasn't busy and the sun was out to shine. It was lovely until we reached the end and then you just turn around. That's it, no looping around, no destination, you just turn around and head back. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taichung\Bike Path.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taichung\Tunnel.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We were looking for somewhere to eat the whole way and didn't find anything, not even a cafe, it wasn't until we rode all the way back to the start that I spotted a tea house. I don't know if it really was the best brown sugar milk tea that I've ever had, or if I was just tired and extra thirsty but oh my did I enjoy my drink. Alex got some mermaid galactic juice which looked cooler than it tasted in my opinion, Alex disagreed. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taichung\Post Bike Drinks.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we talked about what's next. Flights to the Philippines weren't looking too appealing, Hong Kong is out of budget, along with Japan but South Korea on the other hand, surprisingly affordable. The country itself is obviously more expensive, but we've managed to keep costs down so well in Taiwan that surely we can scrape around for 10 days or so in South Korea. I like instant noodles! And 3 meals a day is just a made up concept, right? I'm so excited by the sudden change in plan that I'm actually a bit shell shocked. Are we really going? I've wanted to since I was 14 discovering kpop for the first time. It's almost too exciting, I don't know how to respond. I'll have to refresh the bits of Korean I learnt, and it would be good to relearn how to read Hangul, then I'll have to decide what makeup I can justify buying and which street food we can't skip out on. Where to go, what to do, and in less than 2 weeks! Not to mention it'll be my birthday! Just imagine, I'll be in Seoul celebrating! It's too much.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">When we did eventually get up and return our bikes the rental guy was super friendly and gave us advice on which bus to catch, but Alex wanted the quickest route and so we walked 15 minutes to a different bus stop, I was still being a mong and wasn't concentrating on filling the water bottle up, Alex exasperatedly helped me and by the time he looked up at the road our bus was merrily passing us by. We then had to sit and wait an hour.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We both felt exhausted after finally getting off our bus, having not eaten anything by 6pm. The food vendor round the corner from our flat was selling fried chicken, we bought some, watched it be freshly fried and practically ran back to enjoy it properly. It was piping hot and crispy, the small amount sent us on a fried chicken frenzy to secure more, we went to KLC (no prizes for guessing who they're trying to imitate) and had 4 large pieces of fried chicken with fries, then we went somewhere else for fried bread dessert. We definitely over did it and I don't think we'll be tempted by fried anything for a long time.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 04-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Rooms without windows are such a curse, we struggled to wake up so much this morning, it wasn't too big of an issue though as we decided not to do one of the big day trips in favour of exploring the city. I think we would rather get a feel for a place, than potentially land ourselves in a tourist trap. We've both been so in love with Taiwan that we're hoping to come back, possibly teach English in a few years after Australia? I really want to, and Alex is surprisingly on board. It's all we've talked about today, we've just walked and talked and gotten carried away by how much we want to live here. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taichung\Pink Building.jpeg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We visited the first teahouse to invent boba, Chun Shui Tang in the early 1980s. It's the main reason we came to Taichung and the experience did not disappoint. I got a large milk tea, it came in a pint glass and I enjoyed every sip. Alex was dutiful and took photos and videos for me. Very happy.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taichung\Bubble Tea.jpeg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we strolled around painted animation lane which was a few streets decorated brightly with graffiti. I got a photo sat in the Totoro bus stop and I also tried to have Alex jump on a Goomba but after one shy attempt he refused. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taichung\Totoro.jpeg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We also walked around an old Japanese building which has been refurbished into a literature museum. The centrepiece of the courtyard was a huge ancient tree, it was magnificent and wise. It had also absorbed an entire bike into its roots an eternity ago. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taichung\Tree.jpeg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taichung\Bike.jpeg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">For dinner a steak epiphany occurred. Alex ordered a $160 (£4) steak on rice and redefined what I thought steak was. It was so succulent and tasty, Alex was very smug as he shared a few morsels with me. Then we took a walk in the park and sat on a bench by the lake like old people enjoying retirement. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="111">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="taichung"> 03-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Absolutely no motivation to carry my bag today and the weather is so much hotter than the days previous. I stalled the journey and insisted on breakfast which was a wonderful decision as we stumbled across a local deli type place that served the best tuna toasty of my life, it had salad and egg on there too, scrumptious! Alex got pork wrapped in an omelette with hoisin sauce which was also a 10/10. Taiwan is really taking the lead on food here: toasties, dumplings, noodles and milk tea, what more could a girl want. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We then regrettably began our long journey on several trains. The 3hr local train that's mostly used by commuters took up the majority of the journey and we didn't have reserved seating so we stood up for an hour with our bags balanced between our legs. It was in no way comfortable and we arrived in Taichung tired and ready for sleep but in a bid to fix our sleeping pattern we forced ourselves out and visited the largest night market the city had to offer. Taichung feels a lot bigger than Taipei, the roads are wider and buildings look taller and more commercial but we enjoyed the market. Once again there was lots to look at and I walked around with eyes like saucers, but I held back and settled for a beloved Thai tea. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We found a place that served all things duck, so we shared between us duck noodles and duck rice, however it felt slightly morbid as the interior walls were decorated lovingly with murals of Ducks. Alex said it looked like the Ducks were emerging from the walls to revolt and take over.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taichung\Ducks.jpeg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We stopped by 7/11 for icecreams where Alex picked the nicest ice lolly ever, it was apple flavoured and perfectly tart, with little cubes of frozen apple inside. I was so jealous and he barely shared it with me! I found another thing to want, a themed easycard. 7/11 was selling a cinnamoroll one that I was desperate to get my greedy little hands on.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Back at our place and the room is rather nice, there's one of those mineral shower heads that went viral a few years ago. Not sure if it's actually better but it looks fancy enough. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="110">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 02-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">On our way into the city centre we walked past a charity shop which I very excitedly dragged Alex into. We found all sorts of random tat, including themed playing cards and suncream for a fraction of the usual price. I had fun just looking around. We also had toasties! How wonderful that toasties are popular here.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our actual destination was the huge memorial hall Chang Kai-shek. It really was huge, and built in a startling contrast of brutalism and ornate design. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei\Memorial.jpeg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We also visited the postal museum which was as boring as it sounds, I'm not sure what I was expecting honestly. We made our own fun in the archives as I had Alex guess the national languages of different countries and their year of independence using the summary sheets at the beginning of their stamp collections. My boy’s smart, he was really good at guessing and he already knew all the capitals and most of the colours on the respective flags.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei\Post Museum.jpeg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We then wandered around the historical block, the original heart of Taipei. It's a well preserved Qing Dynasty street from the late 1800s. It was already getting late so we skipped the exhibition and bee lined towards a local grocery market for a small dumpling shop tucked inside. The noodles and steamed gyozas were incredible, so nice we ordered a third bowl to share afterwards. The texture of the noodles were perfect and the place had a really nice atmosphere. Busy but very quiet with the only sound being that of chopsticks clicking against bowls. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei\Brick Swirl.jpeg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei\Noodle Street.jpeg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Our main stomachs were fit for bursting but our dessert bellies had other ideas and Alex spotted a bakery. I do not understand where it went but we both managed to inhale 2 sponge cakes, mine was coffee and extra delicious, Alex picked up a cheese filled sweet bread which I was too sceptical to try.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei\Bread.jpeg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">In the dark we explored Ximending shopping district which was like nothing else. Everything about it was so appealing, I wanted to stop and just look in every single store. Instead I'm going to make a list of things I want, revise that list, and then very conservatively buy things in a time frame manageable for Alex. I cannot wait. I also need to slowly convince Alex to join me in a photobooth. They had tons of shops singularly dedicated to photobooths with the lighting perfected and walls of props and fun headbands but Alex was scared. I'll get him though don't worry, he's not really that good at telling me no.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei\Photobooth.jpeg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei\Lights.jpeg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We then jumped back on the MRT to walk up elephant hill again, this time to appreciate the cityscape at night. It was wonderful, Taipei really feels like somewhere we could stay for a long time.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei\Night Taipei.jpeg" alt="meh">

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="may-week1"> 01-05-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Breakfast was bread, with a side of bread. It was actually really nice, we just went into a convenience store and picked up savoury bread from a counter similar to Lidl and then we found a pack of fluffy slices of honey bread on discount. We don't need to buy water as the tap water in theory is safe to drink, but there's drinking fountains in pretty much all public spaces anyway so we've been making the most of those.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We climbed the stairs up to Elephant Hill for a beautiful view of the city. Taipei 101 is so much taller than everything else around, it makes for a striking cityscape, unlike other 'tallest buildings in the world' contenders Taipei 101 actually looks like it was designed by an architect not just engineers, it's very classy.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei\City.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">As we turned around to walk back down, there was a girl stood posing atop a boulder with the view proudly behind her arched back. You couldn't help but see her and Alex couldn't help but exclaim 'Jesus Christ' louder than he might have wanted as the Taiwanese guy behind him heard and mimicked the phrase laughing, he then nudged his friends and bringing Alex in on the joke laughed more and confirmed 'Jesus Christ'.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">At the bottom of the hill we bought freshly cut pineapple. Different country, same delicious fruit. A Lot of the more popular 'attractions' are closed for labour day so we just walked around and enjoyed bright blue skies. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei\101.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The night market was the best one of the trip so far! We went to the most popular one called Shilin. We tried sweet potato balls that were puffy and gelatinous, and fried dumplings that were to die for. I also got to try the highly anticipated candied fruit skewers, I picked strawberries and they were cold and sweet like jam. Of course I had to get a milk tea as Taiwan is the birthplace of boba and then we sat down in the food court and had extra tasty noodles and healthy tasting shrimp fried rice. Big portions, low prices: we're both happy. Unlocked a new challenge and put both me and Alex to shame, metal chopsticks on slippy noodles. We clearly need more practice.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">In bed I made Alex watch Spirited Away and I think he enjoyed it. Cannot wait to visit Jioufen to see the town that inspired Hayao Miyazaki. We have already decided that we'll definitely need to spend longer here in Taipei, thinking after visiting Taichung and Hualien we'll spend another 3 nights here before flying out, the luxury of last minute planning and not forward booking flights.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="taipei"> 30-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Plane was easy breezy again except Alex was like a walking zombie. We got ourselves hooked up with a sim card and an easy card each for the trains at the airport and were well on our way!</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The journey to our airbnb was almost as long as the flight and my resentment for my backpack steadily grows. The trains are super efficient and frequent like the London underground, but for a fraction of the price, however they do have one unusual quirk: carnival music. From what we can tell each line has a different, equally creepy, circus like jingle. The easy card is making us feel suave like expats on a study trip, the illusion is further maintained by Alex always knowing where he is going and so I can follow and pretend that I do too. New city, no problem! Although Taipei doesn't feel like a capital city really, it's far too spacious, clean and planned out. We dumped our bags and, running on 2 hours sleep and whatever restless shut eye Alex gleaned from the flight, we excitedly rushed out to explore. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">First impressions are just, wow.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It's like I'm being freshly drawn into a scene from an old anime where nothing has changed in the past 50 years except the road signs read Chinese not Japanese. I'm sure if I was personally acquainted with either Japan or China, I would be able to unveil the meshing together that has created Taiwan, however I do not and so to my obtuse eye I just see ANIME. I am enthralled.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">And the fresh air! The sky is blue, the sun is out and there are no bad smells, not even in our dinky shared apartment that keeps a cat in a cage and has a cramped bathroom. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei\Flat Street.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Walking around, even wearing Alex's hoodie, I felt cold. Actual, cold. It was wonderfully refreshing. We walked around the botanical garden and had turkey rice for dinner.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei\Courtyard.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">It might be difficult (for Alex) to spend money with the ever so slightly higher prices, but there's a receipt lottery to take the edge off! Every receipt has a QR code and set of numbers and every month there's a lottery, match the numbers, win some money. Match all the numbers and you get a healthy sized jackpot. I have an app on my phone to keep track of them all and that's about all I know. How fun!</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I was bouncing around on cloud 9, unfortunately the same cannot be said for Alex.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Taipei\Selfie.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We need sleep, on the walk back I dragged us into a stationary turned book shop with anime merch which was the final straw for Alex. We returned after dark and he was already lying curled up in bed watching F1 with one eye shut.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">You've heard of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof but have you heard Rain on a Tin Can Roof because we sure did. Our cute airbnb hut had a corrugated roof insulated with foil, not such a big deal unless you're caught in a thunderstorm. It rained ALL morning and the sound wasn't the relaxing 'isn't it cozy to be indoors' falling rain but rather the relentless and sonorous ‘I'd rather be anywhere else' type. Anyway here Alex is waterproofed and ready to go. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Cat Ba\Bag.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Saw a rat on the balcony, trying desperately to forget about it. Our current flat is not as nice nor as clean as the one prior but it's only for one night. We dumped our bags and went straight back out to hunt down some food. With change going spare and only one day left to spend it we treated ourselves tremendously with burgers, fries and hot wings. A good juicy burger was long awaited and did not disappoint. It might not have been an authentic final meal in Vietnam but it was valued. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Alex slept all morning, counting yesterday, last night and today that must be 20 hours at least. Not only does he generally feel unwell but his wisdom teeth are back causing trouble. By the time we decided to head out and explore all the scooters for hire were taken and we got sent to a different homestay to hire bicycles instead. Cycling on this island is less than ideal, but with nowhere to go otherwise and town being over an hour's walk away we took the rickety bicycles and proceeded to slug them up the rolling hills. The scenery at least was looking really nice until we rode past a fenced off section with posters plastered around the perimeter to advertise their grand plans of mass destruction *construction*, with luxury hotels, villas and mega malls. Replacing thick jungle with young trees planted neatly in a row. It's the same story everywhere we go with any amount of natural beauty, the dollar bills steam roll their way through with 'tourism' plastered across the front, or is it more accurate here to say Chinese yen. It's not that I blame the country for selling out to tourism any chance they get, I just wish there was more effort collectively to develop sensible infrastructure and with consideration for sustainability. It's such a shame to bury thriving ecosystems in concrete and replace azure waters and aquatic life with oil and plastic fish. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Lowest point of the day followed not long after when we found the only ATM that apparently accepted mastercards and visas was broken and we had negative money to our name, still owing our airbnb for meals and the bus. Alex fretted, I sulked but the metaphorical sun broke through the clouds (the real sun has been absent since the start of our Vietnam trip, its somewhere up there, swathed in unnatural clouds) in the space of an hour someone came and fixed the padlocked ATM that had been broken for “weeks”. We had money and we were ready to celebrate the only way we could, with food. I ate 1 and a half large banh mis and thoroughly enjoyed them along with an ice tea. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The ride back was easier as mercifully the relentless uphills from before transformed into glorious downhill slides. We rode past our airbnb and deeper into the national park and enjoyed the best road I've ever cycled down. With lush green mountains reached high on either side, with the road in the middle running wide and flat. It was so beautiful and empty it had the effect of making us feel small and limitless. I far surpassed my personal record of riding without hands as pedaling fast and carelessly was easy. The wind felt amazing and the sounds from the jungle were as bizarre as always.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">It's no wonder we both struggled to sleep in the evening, I got into a pretend argument with Alex and the horrible boy stole the blanket and wrapped it around him like a sausage in a roll, then he slinked out his evil little hand to turn on the AC to full and freeze me into submission. I've never seen such treacherous scheming from him before, the hand shake after I've lost to him in a game is hard enough on my pride but to be shut out like that! As soon as he's back to full health I'm going to ambush him with meanness. Side note from Alex: prior to this Erin had made a point of constantly wafting the covers making me cold, the final straw was when she shamelessly kicked her legs folding the sheets in half, exposing our bottom halves to the cold. Only after that did the above events proceed.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="cat-ba"> 27-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We took a short bus and even shorter boat journey to Cat Ba, arrived at our air bnb nestled into a mountain side by 2.30pm, ate some very bland dry food and then fell asleep for the remaining afternoon. Sleeping for so long isn't really out of character for me, but I woke up several times to Alex still being asleep and was not surprised that when he did wake up he complained of not feeling well. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Cat Ba\Kitten.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We've decided not to go on a boat tour of HaLong Bay, I think seeing the huge pollution problem would only be depressing, everyone that we've met that went has taken the same issue and reading up online a lot of people said the boat tours weren't worth it. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I've come up with a loose plan for tomorrow but if Alex hasn't perked up I'm not going to force him up and out (although maybe I should since I don't get any sympathy when the situation is reversed). </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="104">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 26-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">For breakfast we bought some rock solid doughnuts that only Alex ate, but we also finally tried coconut coffee which was delicious. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We ate more banh mi, this time from a food stall I found on Google, half the price and double the taste. Then we bought a whole pineapple and ate it on a bench by the lake. Pineapple is so much nicer here than back home, you can even eat the centre it's that juicy and soft and it's also far more sweet than acidic. Scrumptious, nearly polished it all off in the one sitting.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hanoi\Pineapple.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We then found a sad book street that was dark and absent of English books. We did more walking around the Old Quarter, looked at all the things I would buy if this was a holiday rather than a stop among many, I nearly bought a tiny impractical bag anyway because it was so cute and then we headed back for a break before meeting Tom. We've not seen him since Saigon and since then he's been riding solo on a motorbike.</p>

							</figure>
							<p class="diary-entries">We met on Beer Street and he brought along a couple that he'd met on the Ha Giang loop. The guy didn't say much but I had a great chat with the girl. We had a few drinks on the plastic chairs out on the street and a few scurries inside when the police rolled through and everyone packed up the tables. It's a bizarre arrangement, the police turn up in what looks like a toy army car, going slow enough to let everyone pack up whilst trying to enforce the rule that you can't put table and chairs out on the street, after they go the tables go back out and the performance is repeated the next half hour or so. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got food together and Alex persuaded everyone to get ice cream so he could keep his happy 3 day streak. We then tried to explain the 'point' of boba to Tom who was not a fan and made a big show of telling us all. We then met up with another group that Tom had also met on the motorbike loop. We quickly discovered that they were all on their way to Cat Ba tomorrow on the same bus! Tom's the only one not joining us but we might get a chance to see him before our flight out of Hanoi on Sunday.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had more drinks back on Beer Street and embarrassingly, mid conversation and sitting with 18 year olds, we were interrupted by 3 Vietnamese men who thought it hilarious to ask my age and then tell me that I looked 17 and so it was funny I was drinking. The woman in Sapa said I look 16 so I suppose there's been an improvement. Alex wasn't sitting with me when it happened so I waited until our walk home to complain, it was really sweet though he comforted me with words I could imagine my mum saying, I felt better but it did make me miss her.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After the conversation however Alex was pacing it back because he 'likes the patterns' on the pavement. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="103">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 25-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Today was gloriously cold, I even had to run back inside to grab my jumper. Alex went out in the morning and picked up a cinnamon pretzel from Auntie Anne's for breakfast, which we thoroughly enjoyed in front of the TV. The only thing missing was a cup of tea. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We walked through the old quarter trying to find a corner shop and were unsuccessful in finding any that were bigger than a shoe box. We are in desperate need of soap, shampoo and suncream, as we have been for a while now. Winmart is a sorry replacement for 7/11. Not only is the weather so much cooler right now but Hanoi is nowhere near as busy as we feared, we've had an easy time strolling around and not getting run over.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Never far from a cafe, we visited the Instagram famous sticky note cafe which was super cute. I added my own note to the collection and enjoyed reading the many cliches on the notes that were left. My personal favourites were 'falling pho you' and 'pagodas are travelling time machines'.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Hanoi\Cafe1.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Hanoi\Cafe2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We then went to Banh mi 25 which has a good reputation for being the best in Hanoi and was absolutely packed but we were actually disappointed. It wasn't anywhere near as tasty as the ones we had in Hoi An. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hanoi\Banh Mi.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">In the evening after dinner we tried for round 2 on the ice creams, this time with beer. It was a much nicer experience and we had an early night drinking and playing house in our flat. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="hanoi"> 24-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Left the homestay and was surprised with a leaving gift! A traditional and very bright H'mong scarf, she even showed me how to wear it. Shame Alex didn't get anything, I'm sure he was jealous after seeing me rock the look.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hanoi\Hmong Dress.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Our bus to Hanoi was Doraemon themed and we got joint beds again which was nice to cuddle up on. We didn't receive a warm welcome when we got to Hanoi, with our taxi driver blatantly ripping us off. We agreed on 50,000, we got to our airbnb and he demanded 100,000, and then tried to give the wrong change back and charge us 150,000. I watched the scene unfold from the open boot as I was dragging our bags out, you should have seen Alex! He wasn't taking any prisoners and would have made himself a permanent resident of the taxi if that's what it took, I was shook. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our airbnb is a cozy flat with a little couch and TV which feels very homely and is by far the most space we've had to ourselves this entire trip. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went out for Mixue ice cream which ended in tears because Alex thought he'd lost me and was really mad which made me cry. We had ordered our ice creams, Alex rushed off to get me a coke and told me to wait, but he ended up being a while and I was worried our ice creams would melt so I went to follow him, I only went as far as the end of the street before turning around and going straight back because I couldn't see him, but in the meantime he had walked a loop of the block, returned to Mixue to find me missing and instantly thought all the worst. I was strolling back and flashed a big smile when I spotted him but like I said, he wasn't feeling so friendly by that point. We got back, made up with each other and snuggled on the couch with our duvet to watch Breaking Bad. You can see the 8 back lights on the TV screen but the comfort and familiarity of the action makes up for it. </p>

						<div id="101">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 23-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Today we decided to tackle a proper hike. There was a little pressure from everyone staying at the homestay to go on a guided tour, it's what everyone does, but for £40 it felt as extortionate as the prices being asked for by the H'mong sellers. The cultural beauty here has definitely been infected by tourism, authenticity is questionable and the same tactics are used by everyone to almost force visitors to buy from them. Anyway, we chose to go solo and had a wonderful time. The sun was masked by clouds and there was a lovely breeze. We walked through a town, over a bridge that had Alex abruptly stop and declare deja vu as he remembered the spot from years before and then we looped around a huge dam. The ladies knew not to mess with us today, when they said 'shopping later' rather than replying politely 'maybe' and letting them tag along we said 'no' just as persistently, they got tired quicker and left, thankfully we didn't run into the two from yesterday who had a promise to cash in. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Sapa\Cows.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Sapa\Bridge.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Motivated to return to Plum for lunch, our walk back from the dam didn't feel too long. We had chips that tasted like the ones from Wetherspoons, thick and crispy with tomato sauce. *mistakenly* we didn't think we were as tired as yesterday and so allowed ourselves to *sit* on the bed once we got back. We fell asleep, again. It was a really good nap though, we woke up before dinner, played rummikub whilst we eavesdropped on a h'mong civil war between our host and a very angry lady with sticks. I have no idea what the argument was over but the lady was terrifying and was gunning for violence. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Sapa\Chips.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We opted out of dinner around the table (we later found out they had a whole duck, organs and all) and we fumbled our way in the dark back to Plum. Alex made friends with the cutest dog that was shy at first and even after cuddles wouldn't make eye contact, then he made friends with a little kid that appeared with a game of connect 4 but did everything except actually play the game. It was nice to see a kid that could pretend-play so well, he was very cute and only left when he got a battle wound from falling on the floor after being tickled. He came running back shouting uncle and jumped in for a hug which made heads turn and Alex very embarrassed. We played some more, mostly games centering around food and then we said goodnight.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Sapa\Fluff.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The dogs on our way back were possessed with the same violence as the woman with all the sticks, very scary.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="100">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 22-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">I had a horrible nightmare, in which I vividly remember the sound of a dog being murdered, probably an outside sound penetrating my dream and getting morbidly twisted.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Breakfast was a buffet with everyone, then we sat outside and showed our books the most impressive view. It is a really unique perspective looking all the way down and across the valley and up the mountain opposite. The shadow of the highest mountain is so large that it's easily mistaken for the sky until you look all the way up. We were joined by a very sleepy dog that lay in a patch of sunlight. The only tyrant to disrupt the peace were the many beefed up Insects on steroids. Even the dusty moths looked big enough to cause a storm and the wasps were cause for immediate evacuation. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Sapa\Home.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Sapa\Dog.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Reluctantly I agreed to go on a hike, which quickly turned into a short walk, then cut down to dragging ourselves up one last hill and calling it quits. The weather does not feel any cooler than the south and the uphill showed no mercy or down hill reprieve. We sidestepped buffalo's and were also chased by little old women that hear the calling of a foreign face and come out in troves. 'Shopping, shopping' the voice gets closer, there's nowhere for you to go and they know it. Very persistently these traditionally dressed H'Mong women attach themselves to tourists for as long as it takes you to give in and 'go shopping'. We felt guilty afterwards but the only thing we could think to do after trying to out climb them uphill was promise to come back later and buy something each...they made us look them in the eye and pinky promise. What punishment are we yet to face for lying so intentionally?  </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Sapa\View2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Sapa\View3.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">I got some great pictures already so I can hardly see what we would gain from suffering a longer walk, besides earning some points with the Germans who seem very proud of their hiking reputation. We came across these milky cotton bud type creatures slinking all over a stalk of bamboo and have absolutely no idea what they are. We also took a path through the bamboo forest and popped out at the top of a rice paddy which was incredible. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Sapa\Bamboo.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Sapa\White.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">In giving up we stumbled across a little restaurant called 'Plum' that had thick milkshakes and a Lime smoothie that tasted like sorbet. We also ordered a French toast sandwich monstrosity which was everything we never knew we needed. Salty and sweet, soft and crunchy, the ham with the American excuse for cheese along with salad bundled up with 3 slices of spongy French toast was an experimental masterpiece. We ordered another one halfway through sharing our first. We got hassled by another seller as we ate, who I'm almost certain swore at us in Vietnamese after she showcased her entire inventory which we held strong and refused to buy.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We then retired to our room for a hearty nap and woke up sweating. The heated blanket in our room must be a joke since it's boiling, even in a windowless room.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Dinner time was once again spent with everyone around the table. It's not really the environment we expected, the listing and all the reviews sold the homestay as 'authentic' with meals spent with the family, but in reality it feels more like a camp, as all the guests get different food at a different table from the locals. The little girl Candy is the only really friendly one, she's maybe 4 yrs old, her unexpectedly proficient english teacher, Peppa Pig has taught her well and she's on track for stealing someone's man. She tried her luck with Alex but he ended up just showing her photos of me on his laptop. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Sapa\Candy.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Everyone bashfully showed off their souvenirs that they were pressured into buying from the ladies. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We were on our bike by 7:30am riding towards Trang An for a boat ride through the mountains. The boat doesn't set off until there's 4 people to fill it so we were worried that we would have to wait a while because it was so early and nobody else was around, however we linked up with a Vietnamese couple that were already sat waiting. Being the first boat to go out the lake was completely still and reflected the surroundings beautifully. The early morning mist was refreshing and the only sound was the familiar chorus of the jungle along with the regular beat from the steady oar. It was peaceful and completely awe inspiring. The couple with us were a little less enchanted and between posing for photos had several sessions of doom scrolling on their phones which was depressing to witness. I didn't really prepare beforehand for the caves, it's pure luck that the route we picked had the least amount of caves but there were still 3 to go through, the first one being 1000m long and incredibly low and jagged at points. It took an absolute eternity to go through with our heads ducked down, and whilst Alex touched the rocks above and said how cool it was, I desperately searched the distance for the end. It was a nightmare, I couldn't escape the thought of just how much crushing weight was above us. We also stopped off at a few temples nestled into the mountains which looked ancient and majestic. I wanted to drink in every sight and sound to save for less peaceful days.</p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Ninh Binh\Erin Temple.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Our bus at 12:30pm to Sapa was 8 hours long and for the first time me and Alex weren't even sat together. I was on a bottom middle bunk which is quite possibly the worst spot and I was tormented by an American family that brought enough snacks to cure a famine. They had everything I wanted! Snickers and sandwiches and crisps. I felt miserable, the whole time someone that wasn't me was happily munching away. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Off the bus, we then had a 40 minute drive out of town, accompanied by a 15 minute uphill walk that was too narrow for the car. It was too dark to see anything besides a spattering of lights but it certainly smells very rural.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">At the homestay we were greeted by everyone sitting around a table drinking. All the other guests bar one are German. We chatted a little whilst we ate some dinner and went to bed. We're a little disappointed by our room since it looks like the only one that doesn't have a nice big window to look out, it's also directly next to the dining room so privacy feels encroached upon. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">I'm full of a cold and feeling very sorry for myself. We had a slow start to the day after breakfast and then rode our bikes to Hang Mua for a short but steep hike up one of the limestone karst peaks. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Ninh Binh\River.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">At the trailhead there was a waterfall and a lake decorated with a few arched bridges and lanterns, all looking onto paddy fields. It was a really nice atmosphere and I was half ready to bail on the climb and relax at the bottom. We did, very slowly, ascend to the top and the view was definitely worth the effort. The enormity of the landscape was breathtaking and the hazy sky only added to the beauty. The 30ft stone dragon that spanned the length of the top peak was a fun obstacle to climb around but a complete mystery as to how they got it up there. It didn't look like it was assembled in pieces, but surely it wasn't carried up as a whole, Alex suggested they chiseled it out in place but that seems equally ridiculous. We just have no idea. Another mystery that only Alex was interested in was the sound of different rocks when he slapped them. Some sounded hollow and 'un-rock-like' slap slap slap he went around testing them all like a self trained geologist. </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Ninh Binh\Alex View.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Lunch was another homely banh mi, along with fresh spring rolls that tasted like they had been filled with Pad thai. Super delicious, I think all fresh spring rolls should contain peanuts. We had banana milkshakes again and, with a happy belly, I felt a little better and less nauseous. I did sleep as soon as we got back to the room though. I'd call it a nap but it was less innocent, I was spark out for 3 hours. Alex left me to explore Chua Bich Dong, I told him to take lots of pictures for me so I wasn't missing out.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex here: I left sleepy Erin and rode over to Chua Bich Dong. I was greeted by the archway pictured below and proceeded to explore the temples and caves hidden inside. I got to a tree with a sign hanging off stating ‘Do not climb’ and thought it peculiar that it was forbidden to climb only that specific tree. Anyway, I then climbed the rugged, rocky and overgrown ‘path’ that led to incredible 360 views with nobody else around. How strange. During my ascent, I made the mistake of catching the lip of my shoe on the underside of a rock, in the same way I did getting onto that ferry in Hon Son where I fell, which ripped the front part of the shoe from the lip at the bottom of the laces. I am gutted. I then continued exploring the parts where I was allowed to be and got talking to a Canadian called Anish whose girlfriend was also tired. We shared our stories for a little while and once we parted ways I had a sweaty ride back to Erin.</p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Ninh Binh\Ripped Shoe.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">I joked with Alex in the morning that by the time we go back home in July we will have spent so much time together that we will have become one. Obviously this is something he wants and so we practiced with the word association game to speed up the process. I think it's working because I woke up from my mid day beauty sleep, got up and looked out the window idly to see Alex walk down the street on his way in! He didn't message or tell me what time he was planning to come back, I must have sensed him get closer! I think telepathy is our next logical advancement.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our plans are constantly falling apart and reforming. Do we tackle the Ha Giang motorbike loop? Do we volunteer in Taiwan or go to the Philippines sooner? Northern Thailand or Indonesia? So many decisions, we both agree that we prefer being by the sea somewhere we can dive and swim, so it's looking like we'll cut Taiwan down to 10 days and then if we do want to volunteer and base ourselves somewhere for a while to do that in the Philippines, but we decide something different every week, which is fine by me!</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had a feast for dinner, polished off 4 plates of food without a pause, with more banana milkshakes. I think I might need to wean Alex off the milkshakes however since he got frenzied and said he wanted it intravenously on a drip. It's a good milkshake, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't need injecting into anyone's bloodstream. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="ninh-binh"> 19-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were picked up like orphans looking bleary eyed and lost at 5:30 when the restaurant opened up. We were allowed to check in, which was fantastic. Alex opened up his laptop for Lord of the Rings and we fell asleep in the daylight almost instantly.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After our nap and feeling fresh as a daisy, we met our hosts who gave us bicycles to use and upgraded our room for a better view. I still wouldn't necessarily call it a 'mountain view' but it's nice enough. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our first adventure was to the non-touristy non-pleasant concrete jungle of Ninh Binh for the ever illusive 'good ATM'. Alex is still a maniac when it comes to the lore of ATM's. I think he gets a thrill from finding the lowest fee with the highest amount, like a bargain hunter diving in bins. We rode for 30 minutes in the wobbly ditch at the edge of the road for fear of getting trampled but hey ho we got our 1% in the end.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I have a really bad cough and the piles of burning leaves at the road edges are not helping. There are little fires everywhere. We did get a sneak peak at the shadowy limestone mountain landscape as dusk was falling, and we saw a herd of cows taking a bath! They were adorable with just their heads sticking out and ears flapping against the surface.  </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We both woke up not feeling very excited for the day ahead, with 5 hours to kill in the afternoon before our 12 hour night bus. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex helped me cut my hair in the morning, nothing drastic, just a few choppy layers since I was feeling bored. I think he did a good job, even if he did look terrified. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went out for overpriced drinks again which involved more sweating. I sent a postcard home to my nephew but mail has been getting back really slowly. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spoke to an Aussie on the bus who is temporarily working as a nurse in the UK, although from the sounds of it she's been doing her best to not spend time there, she's from Perth and said when we get there to reach out and she can show us around.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hue\Bus.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">I felt restless and a little travel sick on the bus, Alex only got a few hours sleep too. For whatever reason it just wasn't working out for us. We arrived in Ninh Binh ahead of schedule which meant perching outside our homestay in the dark at 4:45am locked out. We sat in a closed restaurant wondering which animal we can hear is most likely to attack. My bet was on the pack of dogs, but the wasp came closer. Think we both felt safer when the frog joined us.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We were lazy and our bodies were sore. We walked, slowly, with several cafe stops along the way, over to the citadel but the entry was expensive so we just had a peek through the doorway and walked around the outside. We debated how many bed sheets could fit inside the huge Vietnam flag, but we couldn't then find a definitive answer online as to how large the flag exactly was. Very unsatisfying. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">For dinner we had a set menu which was an experience. Things started off tame with beef noodle soup, then we got a platter of make-your-own spring rolls which all tasted familiar even if it looked unusual like the stuffed rice pancake, but then we got...*refers back to menu* loc cake and rice cake with diced shrimp. Wrapped inside the boiled banana leaf was 'tapioca flour' which was a transparent chewy gelatinous block with a shrimp suspended in the middle, with its crunchy outer shell intact. Some textures nicely contrast each other, some do not...this was definitely the latter. I don't even know how to describe what was inside the petri dishes. Alex persevered and ate it all, but the two couples closest to us also joked about how bizarre it was. We returned to normalcy with fried rice and watermelon slices. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 16-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got a happy send off from our host at Terracotta and said goodbye to our big backpacks. We had 8 hours to get ourselves to our hostel in Hue on the scooter where our bags would be dropped off. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hai Van\Send Off.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The first stop we made was at the Marble mountain, it provided a nice viewpoint and unexpected work out for our legs. The town surrounding the mountain appeared to exclusively deal in marble statues, selling everything from dragons to laughing buddhas ranging from the size of a rubber to 10ft tall. It was a spectacle to drive through, just a shame Alex couldn't look around as leisurely as me since he was driving and the roads were chaos. Not as busy as city centres but still, you had to be prepared for anything, at any moment. Roundabouts were particularly challenging as although we had already observed the phenomenon of giving way to people joining the roundabout, we did almost get trampled by a double decker bus that didn't even cautiously slow down as it entered the roundabout. Lesson learnt.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Hai Van\Marble.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Hai Van\Marble View.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Our next stop was not one recommended but added in impromptu by Alex, the ....Airport, unfortunately for Alex we couldn't find anywhere with a good view of the runway, however the one plane we did see is probably the only plane I'll ever be interested in, a .... sanrio plane! It's so cute I love it! Why aren't any other planes decorated so playfully?</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hai Van\Eva Air.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We stopped for food in Da Nang Bay and got quickly tripped up with our limited Vietnamese. Chinh had taught us how to ask for iced coffee and so Alex confidently did as much in a small cafe where nobody spoke English, however that seemed to indicate to our server a higher level of proficiency than we had, who in response spoke more Vietnamese to us. Dumbly we could only reply 'Cafe Da'. One of the kids staring and giggling did work up some confidence and approached us for a very rehearsed conversation in English which was sweet.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We then tackled the Hai Van pass. What started as very exciting quickly became a test of endurance as the clouds were rather dense and wet. It was like riding head first into a very cold giant room humidifier. Not to gloat but I did suggest in the morning that we bring our raincoats but know-it-all-Alex predicted clear skies. The wetness continued further than the low clouds extended and Alex did eventually have to admit that it was in fact raining. Was it all worth it when we found the spot from top gear? I would actually say it was :) I even recorded the rhythmic pitta-pitta from the fishing boat looping around and disappearing under the bridge. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Hai Van\Hai Van.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Hai Van\Hai Van TG.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The rain got worse, Alex's summery beach shirt became a mocking insult as the weather resembled the dreary lake district. I reluctantly offered him my warm flannel shirt as he was soaking wet and shivering. He must have been feeling really rough since he actually took it.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Still several hours away there was a rush to finish the journey before nightfall and we were growing increasingly uncomfortable sitting on the bike, but on the flip side the places we were driving through were just incredible. I wish we had longer to stop and really explore because for over an hour we drove past stretching fields full of beautiful and ornate tombs. An eclectic mess, these cemeteries were like nothing we've seen before and they seemed to extend infinitely, the upturned roofs and acroterion imitated the shape of the trees in the distance so it was impossible to distinguish where the shrines ended and the forest took over. Some were brightly painted but most were pallid and crumbling, each one had a unique personality and looked as though it did not expect to find itself in a field among so many others. There were larger tombs arranged in rows along the road like regular pretty houses except rather than gardens and windows they had courtyards, decorative pillars and always 3 large equally spaced doorways. Whilst all of this unfolded on our right side, to the left was an equal expanse of flooded marshy fields that in the dimming light looked forgotten and vaguely haunted.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Hai Van\Cemetry.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Hai Van\Cemetry2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We also saw a huge pimped up church like from romeo and juliet with neon tube lights and a coloured portrait of Mary under a sparkling cross 20ft high and dazzling. I also finally witnessed a new record for number of people on one bike at 5. There had been a lot of 4's but 5! There was a toddler at the front, a father driving and then mother holding a baby with a toddler sandwiched in between. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Arriving in Hue after nightfall the town was already bustling and we struggled to navigate our way to the hostel around traffic and closed off roads, Alex did a good job keeping his cool. We checked in easily, and were welcomed with a fruit platter, our bags then arrived and we were taken to our room. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I found an introductory book on Buddhism on our shelf and couldn't put it down once I started reading. It was so insightful, I know I'm going to annoy Alex tirelessly with all my big brain knowledge now, but whilst I found the book highly interesting and will take some of the lessons I found, I won't be renouncing all personal possessions just yet, I'm very attached to my new dress already.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 15-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Back to the tailors in the morning for a less confident fitting, they've lost the shape by making it wider so now they're going to take in the waist. I'll just have to wait and see when I go to pick it up tonight. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we went to the pottery museum, who'da thought it'd be so cool! We were more impressed with the terracotta angkor wat than the real one and the taj mahal was great! Alex was insulted that London was only half finished, with Tower Bridge missing its bridge and Big Ben missing half of parliament. We had drinks there and Alex made the mistake of ordering salty lemonade. It was literally salty lemonade, I think it'll be the last time curiosity gets the better of us.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Hoi An\Tower Bridge.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Hoi An\Taj Mahal.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We then slept for a few hours, or at least I did, I'm not sure what Alex was up to. We woke up with big appetites and jumped straight on our bikes to try the famous bahn mi. Anthony Bordain rated it the best Bahn Mi in Hoi An and honestly, it really was. The disorganised queue outside wasn't actually too bad and the food was worth the wait tenfold. Alex had the 'mixed' and I tried 'beef and cheese'. Everything about them both was perfect, from the warm bread that you could smell baking out on the street, to the meat, salad and mix of sauces. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hoi An\Bahn Mi.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Riding the high of a happy belly, we impulsively stopped by a massage parlour so that I could get my nails done. We had just been walking past and I loved the selection of colours out on the board. Several women who worked there came over whilst I was getting my nails done and stared at me very intently and very close. They spoke only Vietnamese to the lady doing my nails and would just throw in the word 'beautiful'. One of them pointed at my nose so maybe they were complimenting my nose like the girl in Laos, however I'm not really convinced, it felt more like a cover up because they were clearly gossiping. After a little coaxing from me, Alex agreed to treat himself to a foot massage. It was very cute, as soon as he asked for one he was already throwing his flip flops off and wiggling his toes excitedly. Then I think he fell asleep, although he denies this.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Hoi An\Massage.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Hoi An\Nails.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Back at the tailors and my dress was finished and exactly what I wanted. It fits like a glove, it feels amazing and even better, Alex likes it too! Shame I'll have to wait to wear it now.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hoi An\Dress.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We then had a drink, tiger no less! Then we walked down the river that was alive with paper lanterns and even had a little boat trip where we dropped in our own. Mine was pink, Alex's was yellow and it looked like they stayed together. We had some nice photos taken and then enjoyed the view and experience, ducking under the bridge was briefly scary. I know I already said this in Saigon, but I really do feel spoiled lately. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hoi An\Boat.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We finished the night with more drinking, during which we ranked every single place we have been thus far, tried to match each other's sips, and played a plethora of online Quizzes as we fell down the rabbit hole and impressed ourselves with getting full marks on a multiple choice quiz naming colours.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Always hungry we stopped at a corner shop for instant noodles and fell asleep watching the second lord of the rings. It took us a whole week to finish the first one in the trilogy. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="92">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 14-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">There is nothing better than staying somewhere that offers free breakfast. It motivates us to get up early, we end up eating more than one meal a day and it tastes delicious! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">My fitting at the Tailors went really well. The dress was all but finished and just needed buttons. It was just a little too snug around my ribs but besides that it was perfect. The sleeves are long like I asked and the waist was dropped so it's more like a corset, the length is great and the material feels soft and light without being see-through. I'm just praying she doesn't take out any of the pleats to give the extra room because I loved the shape, guess I'll find out tomorrow when I go back. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we went on a long bike ride to the beach, Alex took us on a tour of the pretty hotel he stayed in last time with his family. Then we sat on deck chairs and enjoyed the most familiar beach we've been on. The sea was a restless grey not unlike home, the wind made the temperature much cooler than usual and there was almost no direct sunlight, it felt like home. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The change was actually welcome as it made swimming more exciting, Alex threw himself head first into waves and I danced around the edge getting cold. We shared pineapple and a disappointingly small portion of prawn crackers on the beach, buried Alex's foot in the sand and I even got to read some of my book, overall it was good. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We then jumped back on our bikes for lunch and in a case of the worst possible timing found ourselves riding back to the homestay during rush hour. We got caught up in the madness of school pick ups, almost flattened going through junctions and nearly frightened off my bike just from the horn of an approaching bus. It was chaos, I could feel the cortisol pulsing through my blood. It's no wonder Alex fell asleep after we got back and showered, he somehow navigated the entire route back only getting turned around once. We did get to join in on all of the honking with our dinky little bells. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I do need to note that bananas be tasting really good at the moment. Thailand only had the short stumpy bananas that were soft and sweet, but here we've consistently been getting the nicer ones. You can taste the difference in the smoothies too! I also love how restaurants offer free fruit most of the time. We've been having some really great watermelon and the pineapple today really was exceptional.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="91">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="hoi-an"> 13-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">The bus was fine, once again I didn't feel sleepy until the morning. We arrived at Terracotta Homestay by 8am and were immediately greeted by our host who shuffled us in eagerly and gave us lots of recommendations and leaflets, she even told us a few different options for getting to our next stop. We were then able to check in and she made us breakfast! </p>
							<figure class="lone-image">
								<img class="diary-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hoi An\Dogs.jpg" alt="Merdeka Tower">
								<figcaption>Also greeted by 5 friendly dogs.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our room might be the nicest one yet, the bed is gigantic and the shower is a dream, although the water does have a funny earthy smell, I have a suspicion that it has something to do with terracotta. Not only is our homestay called Terracotta, but the surrounding small village is also heavily themed around pottery. I think they have a park, cafe and museum to match, strange but quaint.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We rode push bikes into the town which is very reminiscent of Luang Prabang except Hoi An is clearly much busier. Everything is very pretty and the colourful (but mostly yellow) colonial buildings are of course picturesque. We went to a Tailors with my idea for a shirt dress, Alex did well to negotiate the price despite the frosty sales lady and then I awkwardly got measured up. My first fitting is tomorrow, I don't want to get excited in case it's an absolute disaster but Alex keeps hyping me up, he's offered to buy it as a birthday present for me. We walked past another tailors, there are hundreds, and I saw the perfect shirt and shorts set in a sandy oatmeal colour that I loved. It didn't need tailoring and I was happy to buy it exactly as it was which hopefully made it cheaper, who knows but it's mine now :)</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We came back and agreed not to nap, then we took an awfully long nap together and woke up late in the afternoon. I must still be tired however because I cried over a cockroach touching my foot and then again when Alex killed a fly on my back.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We argued over whether to go out for food, struggled to find somewhere close and cheap and didn't ask our host until 10pm what time she stopped serving food. She replied on WhatsApp 'what would you like my friend' she happily cooked us rice, noodles and spring rolls at nearly 11pm! I wouldn't even expect that from my own mum. Like many of the hosts we've had the pleasure of staying with, she is too kind.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="90">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 12-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We weren't super excited to look around Nha Trang, we checked out of the hotel as late as possible and still had 7 hours to kill before the night bus. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Only real highlight to mention was the iced mint chocolate drink with cheese foam that Alex ordered in a cafe. It tasted really good if you could ignore the tang from the cheese, we also sat in another cafe to leach on their plug sockets and I had a really nice ginger tea.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex has been fed up with moving so frequently from place to place for a while and I think I'm beginning to feel it now too after so many long busses so we've decided for Taiwan to maybe volunteer at a hostel in exchange for free bed & board. I did a little research and emailed a few hostels in Taitung, which is a surf town on the East Coast, just waiting to hear back from them now. Trying to not get carried away but we're both getting really excited by the prospect of being somewhere a little more permanently and doing a bit of work. Added bonus if we both learn to surf!</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The night bus was as expected, we got the back seats which gives us a little more room and we got talking to an outgoing Sri Lankan born Aussie that's just in Vietnam for 2 weeks visiting for a friend's wedding. The journey still felt long though, and we'd eaten our prawn crackers and cookies within 30 minutes of setting off.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="89">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 11-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">I can't believe we're at day 90 in our travels already! The time goes so quickly and there's still so many places left to see.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I slept for over 12 hours in the night and slept again on the bus for the 6 hour journey to Nha Trang which went pleasantly. We were on one of those flimsy looking sleeper buses again but this time we had the very back seats which felt cozier and had more leg room for Alex. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Once again we're surprised that Nha Trang is such a crowded, built up city. The streets are lined with ads and bright lights fighting for your attention and everyone is trying to sell something. Still we managed to find somewhere quiet to eat and enjoyed an ice cream before going back to our room to watch Lord of the Rings and relax in our bath! It's the first bath we've had and was completely unexpected for a hotel room that only cost £6. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="88">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="apr-week2"> 10-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We felt a little bit lost in Mui Ne since we only had the one day to explore. The red sand dunes were a little too far out to be worth visiting so we stayed close to the hotel and went to check out the beach instead. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex was hoping to go surfing so I think he was disappointed to see the beach and shore scattered with kites. Hundreds of people were kitesurfing, which I thought was really exciting but it's not what Alex wanted to do, however it wouldn't have made any difference anyway because lessons were just as expensive as scuba diving and we can only afford one expensive hobby. I'll add it to my bucket list and maybe save it for Australia.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We sat at the beach a while just watching, then we went to the shop to treat ourselves to a late easter treat. We shared a Snickers and it was so much nicer than I remembered them ever being. Soft caramel, crunchy peanuts and the outer layer of chocolate just beginning to melt, delicious! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent the rest of the day reading and playing games in our room, I did a little bit of washing and we booked our bus for tomorrow and grabbed food. Easy and uneventful day which is just as well because I'm not feeling awfully great.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="87">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="mui-ne"> 09-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Early start with the Cu Chi tunnels. I didn't realise they were such a long drive away but it took us 2 hours there and back on the bus. We saw the different traps that were laid during the guerrilla warfare and tried to keep up with the history being shared, but the guide spoke fast and clipped the end of each word so unfortunately I think we missed some details. The tunnels were small, although they had been made wider for visitors and I very quickly panicked once we entered. It felt claustrophobic enough without people shuffling along, single file in front and behind you. I left the first chance I got at 20 metres, Alex went the entire 100m right the way through. I think caves and tunnels are my new biggest fear, right up there with rats. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were back in the early afternoon feeling hot and sleepy. The next bus to Mui Ne wasn't until 7pm and so we went cafe hopping once again, making it our 6th Cafe in 3 days. I would happily spend weeks here drifting between cups of coffee with my books. I wonder how long it would take to visit every cafe and try every bite sized cake. I forgot to mention earlier but yesterday we shared a warm croissant dipped in condensed milk, and today we had a mini lemon drizzle cake. We might have been staying in a hostel dorm but it feels like I've been on a European city break, hmm... not quite, maybe if Europe was a little more honest about their wars, and a little less vigilant on hygiene. Alex has an affinity for spotting disgusting old men peeing in public spaces. He's caught 6 so far in the act.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Saigon\Lush Cafe.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Saigon\Lemon Cake.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Our bus this time was less luxurious and Alex looked rather cramped, but it was still far nicer than sitting upright. We arrived in Mui Ne after 12 and so have seen nothing besides our room. The choice of bathroom decoration is unsettling…</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 08-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were supposed to visit the Cu Chi tunnels in the morning but we've rearranged to go tomorrow instead which meant we had a day free to continue collecting books! Today was even better because Alex was able to trade in his Donna Tart book for two books from the library bus. Luckily they had too many English books so were happy for us to take some off their hands, free of charge! I also bought the cutest tote bag to carry all my books around to the different cafe's we explored. I feel so spoiled.  </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had lunch sat out on the pavement at a hawkers stall where we tried bun thit nuong which was cold rice noodles, grilled pork, a spring roll and some veggies in a bowl along with a dipping sauce. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Saigon\Lemon Drink.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We invited Tom to join us in a cafe which was in a particularly derelict building; graffiti on the wall, blown out windows, frequent power cuts. I'm surprised he trusted us enough to come but once you enter the venues inside they're as cozy and hip as any place in London. We started in a cafe that had very cute resident cats, then we had a look around the rest of the building and found a dimly lit intimate bar with live music. The two young Vietnamese guys were really impressive, even if they did invite up a lovestruck boy with baby fat to sing along with them for a song. We lounged on the floor of the mezzanine sipping tea and enjoyed the performance like a private concert until they had a technical problem with the amp and we moved on upwards.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Saigon\Cats Cafe.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Saigon\Live Band.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">A few stories up and we heard music again but struggled to find an obvious entrance. We opened one glass door and the music got louder but then we were awkwardly stood in a vestibule guarded by a heavy black door with only a wooden panel to slide. We hesitated, backed out, creeped forward, had a peak, backed out again, looked around, looked at eachother, giggled and resolved to let Tom do it. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Saigon\Abandoned.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The big man plucked up the courage and led the way, engulfing us into a speakeasy where the air was thick and well dressed couples stretched out into the shadows. The performer had a powerful voice and even dipped into opera, and the accompanying violinist, guitarist and electric drums were flawless. The three of us coddled our expensive beers and drank in every sound and sight. There was briefly a power cut that the singer didn't hesitate to battle through and I don't think I have ever, or will ever, be in a place that is so cool again. We felt like urban explorers with a VIP invitation, it was just a shame our wallets couldn't be as supportive, we reluctantly left after the one drink.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="85">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 07-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Busy, busy city day, which are usually the worst kind of days but Saigon has found its place at the top of our favourite city list. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We kicked the morning off strong with a visit to book street, which was something from a dream. Just being surrounded by so many books was exciting and that was before I even bought any! So grateful to have found the one english shop selling second hand books, I was able to find 'Oliver Twist' It's nice and floppy with a big font, 'Do androids dream of electric sheep' which has been on my list to read for a while, and 'The time traveller's wife' which I think Alex wants to read first. For himself he got 'Poor Economics' which I think he was self conscious about until he showed Tom back at the hostel who is also a massive nerd. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Saigon\Bookstore.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The Vietnamese books were all especially beautiful. Even the regular copies were bold and striking but their special editions! I'm so jealous. I came so close to buying the Vietnamese hardback of 'Howels Moving Castle' I've never seen a nicer copy.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We sat down in a cafe that looks onto the street and wrote our little notes to send home which we then posted at the very grand and imposing Saigon post office. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Saigon\Post Office.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We couldn't skip out on the War remnants museum so we headed there next. Very sobering once you look past the impressive planes and tanks.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Saigon\Tank.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Saigon\Gun.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Keeping in theme afterwards I surprised Alex by taking him to a restaurant with a secret underground basement. The house served as a meeting place for the Viet Cong during the war and would often store weapons and transport secret messages. There was a power cut when we visited so we went down in the dark which was extra spooky but did make taking photos difficult. We also tried broken rice and pork chop as it was served during the war time, predominantly to the Korean soldiers. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Saigon\Hole.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Furthering our quest for good food I also found a place that served 'waterfall chicken' which I can explain with a picture. True to its reputation though it was some of the nicest fried chicken we have tried, and surprisingly was not greasy or overly crispy. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Saigon\Dripping.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We then went to explore one of the many Coffee apartments that litter the apartment blocks in the city. On the second floor of a dingy looking complex we found a cosy cafe where we could sit on the balcony, admire the closing night and enjoy an egg coffee. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Saigon\Cafe.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Back at the hostel we met Fatima who was the 6th member of our now full dorm, she is from Mexico but studying for a semester in Singapore. She was already chatting with Tom when we arrived and the four of us then proceeded to stay up late, sit up on the top bunks together and like giddy school girls having a sleepover on a weekday gossiped and told embarrassing stories. It was 3am before the Finnish came back from their night drunk and bubbly from laughing gas. They joined us for a while and together we all found something to really laugh over. It was fun and felt very wholesome. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="84">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="saigon"> 06-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex had quite the man made disaster in the night which at 3am I had little sympathy for. He woke up to go the toilet and *thoughtlessly* switched the light on outside (the bathroom is on the balcony) before he could even shimmy down his shorts he was attacked by a swarm of moth-like flies. He again *thoughtlessly* ran inside without turning the light back off and in a panic woke me up to watch through our window as the swarm steadily grew around the light. It got worse as we listened to them flicker and tap against the window. They began to slip under the gap in the door and that's when Alex really lost the remainder of his sanity and, brandishing his sandal, erratically smacked at the floor to stop them. I told him to get a grip and go back outside to switch the light off. I even helpfully came up with the solution to wear his raincoat if he was that scared of them touching him. In the end we both stood at the door in our coats and hoods pulled tight like pillocks arguing over who should do it. In the end I went, in my shoes (because the floor was covered in them) and with a snorkel mask fitted snugly in around my coat (in case they went up my nose) it took me less than 10 seconds to get the light off. Alex uncrossed his legs and ran to the toilet and I went back to sleep. An absolute upheaval. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Breakfast again was delicious and Chinh had more yoghurt for us! We made another video for the host, this time a little more confidently and I wrote a nice description of the homestay in English for her to use when listing the stay online as Chinh was in the process of helping her. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent the rest of the morning enjoying the quiet outdoors and then Chinh treated us to homemade beef noodles and a cutely packaged snack of rice cooked with banana and beans wrapped in a coconut leaf. It was a shame to leave, we felt so welcomed and comfortable there. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Rice Thing.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex narrowly avoided another disaster as he very nearly launched his backpack over the side of the pier. The last time Alex was in Vietnam 4 years ago with his family he spent a good amount of worry on his Dad, fearing that he was losing his marbles as he apparently kept tripping on everything. Flash forward to Alex following in his father's fumbled footsteps he missed the step whilst walking onto the ferry and got both his feet stuck under the lip of the above step and briefly found himself completely horizontal and without a bag. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The rest of the journey was comfortable and uneventful. In Rach Gia we got a 6hr sleeper bus to Ho Chi Minh City and checked into our hostel. We share our room with another Brit, called Tom, who was immediately likeable and friendly and two Finnish whose names I didn't catch. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 05-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">I wrote this in the middle of the night like a damsel from the 17th Century: 'The ferocity of the rain scares me. It's not the same as British rain. It feels too much for our home on stilts and I can't sleep for worry.' Sounds like I'm auditioning to be the 5th sister in Little Women. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had breakfast with Chinh, who in his 30 years travelling, has a story from every country in the world and plenty of historical tidbits to share. He's very easy to talk to and gave us frozen yoghurt that tasted just like a Froob back home! He explained that our host, Hiền, doesn't usually get foreign tourists and would like to make a video with us to advertise the homestay. She rehearsed her questions in English and joined us on the bench where we all smiled through our shyness as best we could. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Chinh then took us at another beach from yesterday and shared his guava, he also recommended we try tamarind juice. I can't explain the flavour but it tasted nicer than you might expect, the peanuts and cherries on top were an interesting addition. We had the beach entirely to ourselves as Vietnamese tourists rarely visit on the weekdays, but it feels as though we have the entire island to ourselves it's so quiet. Dips in the conversation were filled only by the sound of cicadas, birds and the gentle crashing of waves. Chinh was great company, even if he and Alex had a standoff over whether Finland was ever part of the Soviet Union. Google played referee and we could decide they were both simultaneously right and wrong as Finland was once part of Russia, but never the Soviet Union.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Tamarind Drink.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Tamarind.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Chinh then took us out for 'fish fondue' which was a fun experience but I really didn't enjoy watching the grouper be plucked from the tank and mercilessly diced as it struggled on the floor. I kept thinking how much I would have loved to watch it if we went diving. They had caught such lovely fish. I happily shared the noodles and broth but left the fish to Alex and Chinh who looked to have thoroughly enjoyed themselves. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Food.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then Chinh really took on the role of tour guide and armed with his 'hiking stick' took us to his favourite meditation spot up on a hill. It was beautiful and quiet. We all laid down on a big rock and said nothing. The ocean breeze was particularly calming. An old Man used to live on the top of the hill. There were small stones arranged like tables and workbenches, and a poem carved into the wall of the largest stone that we couldn't read. His body is buried not far away apparently but we didn't go looking. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Hike.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Rock.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent the evening sitting on plastic chairs facing out onto the main square, under the full moon with coffee and a beef and quail egg filled bao bun. A man approached us with fishing rods and Chinh said to go with him so we were faithfully led down the pier and onto a boat overrun with children to fish for squid. It was dark and the man kept speaking in Vietnamese, at one point he acted out swimming and both me and Alex nervously laughed thinking we were about to be thrown overboard. The children had remembered Alex's name from the night before and echoed it around until Alex got sick of it and told them mine, they responded in unison which made my heart melt a little. Alex spotted a Manchester United shirt and so the rest of the conversation became a back and forth of footballers names with a few cheers. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Moon.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">After an exciting false alarm where my big fish ended up being a soggy piece of fabric attached to the back of the boat, we gave up and returned to land unsuccessfully.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Fishing.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">It felt like a day where anything was possible, without having to think too much. I could just lay back and let good things happen. New places, new tastes, new experiences, new conversations, all delivered to me like convenient little packages.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="82">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 04-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Breakfast arrived as promised and was actually really good. We ate on the balcony and listened to the natural chorus of the surrounding jungle. I could have sat there for hours but we instead resolved to go swimming. The water was warm and clear but with not much to look at, so we didn't swim for long. Instead I noticed the little pebbles being washed up by the shore were in fact thousands of teeny tiny shells that were just waiting to be collected by me. Alex joined in and together we found the smallest prettiest ones we could, his were always nicer because my eyes let me down.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Mini Shells.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Counting.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">For lunch we conceded to enjoy whatever was brought out to us as ordering ourselves caused mass confusion. In the end a plate of seafood noodles arrived which tasted mild and fresh. The soy sauce tastes so much better than back home. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We rode the scooter further around the island and became suddenly trapped in the enclosed maze that makes up the fishing village. We were funnelled through and directed down side alleys, passageways and around market stalls to seemingly no end. I half expected to be squeezed into juice, then we could be served with the fish as a delicacy. Maybe that's what happened to all the other foreigners?</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We made it out *alive* and spent the hottest part of the day lounging around back at the homestay. We hurried back out for the sunset, which made a pink kaleidoscope of the sky, and sat on a huge rock overlooking the sea. It was all very nice and calm until bats materialised out of the shadows and performed kamikaze dives over our heads. Alex is no braver than me and would have left me behind had I been any slower climbing down. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Sunset.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Back in the town we bumped into our Vietnamese-American neighbour, Chinh who has been staying on the island for over a month. He recommended a place to get Pho and offered to take us on a trek tomorrow. We also stumbled into the only other white tourists on the island who shared the same surprise as us. They were middle aged American guys saddled up next to two Vietnamese women, they complained about being bored and nobody speaking English. Typical Americans right? We didn't hang around but made our excuses in the form of a drink stand further up the street. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We ordered milk tea and pineapple juice, but we got served peach tea and whatever this sweet abomination is. We drank them both with wide smiles as the lady running the stand was so happy to have apparently understood our order. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Weird Drinks.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex had a formal introduction with some local boys who shook his hand and enthusiastically repeated his name. It was very sweet, unlike some places we've visited the stares here all look friendly and so rather than feeling embarrassed and self conscious we are role playing celebrities. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="81">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="hon-son"> 03-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">The journey was comfortable on a semi sleeper but our seats were right at the back and felt spring loaded. I was actually lifted off my seat when we hit a speed bump, so no chance of sleeping. I was also lying next to a man that sounded like a broken lawn mower when he snored.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our connecting shuttle to the port had the same plastic wrapped roof as all our taxis. I've not noticed it in any other country so far and I can't think of an explanation. Are they preparing to commit a crime scene in the cosmos? Have an alien splayed against the roof and dissected? It would be an easy clean up. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex ate something random and slightly scary for breakfast on seats so small it looked like he might be feeding his knee instead of his mouth  then we waited 3 hrs for the boat where I briefly died. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Porridge.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Nap.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Somehow everything worked out perfectly, we were recognised by Hiền on the pier who along with a friend on motorbikes took us to the homestay. I nearly tumbled backwards several times being sat pillion with my big bag still on. Not looking forward to doing that again.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Room View.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The homestay is perfect, we have a big room, ensuite and a balcony with a stunning view. Bananas are growing on trees within reaching distance and from the vantage point of uphill we can see right back down to the bay and ocean. Oh and not to forget, Chanel bed covers no less. We also get breakfast included tomorrow and free use of the bikes. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Hon Son\Bed2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex was excited to ride a semi automatic for the first time so we went for a quick ride. We only saw a fraction of the island's natural beauty and it was still utterly breathtaking. The island is a palm speckled jungle rising and falling with the hilly landscape. We can't believe this place exists away from tourism and feel incredibly cheeky to have found it. So far we've not seen any other white people and judging from the curious stares we've been getting I don't think we're likely to. We had a fun time communicating via Google translate with very smiley lads who very purposefully sat next to us in a restaurant and didn't order anything. They peered over Alex's shoulder for a good while before speaking to us. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Regrettably we slept the rest of the day, but briefly waking up to see the rain made it feel okay, and I know we'll wake up tomorrow with enough energy to make the most of our 2 days here. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="80">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 02-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We woke up and very quickly completely changed our plans for the next few days. We spoke to our host, Jess about things to do in Can Tho but the tours were expensive and there's not much else, then she asked where else in Vietnam we were going and recommended an island called Hòn Sơn that's popular among Vietnamese holidayers. Alex looked at some pictures and knew he immediately wanted to go. However, huge problem, we can't speak Vietnamese and to book the ferry and any homestay on the island you need to ring up, or navigate the non- English website. We spoke to our host again and completely relied upon her to arrange everything. She really did everything for us, even writing a note to give to the bus company and ferry and ringing up her friend so that we could stay at her homestay. It's very last minute and we're putting a lot of faith in Jess but we've decided to leave Can Tho a night early and get the bus tonight at 2am.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Happy with our slapdash plans we went out to explore a different part of town. As soon as we stepped out of the taxi we were caught in rain that was stronger than 90% of the showers we've had here. We stood in a door entrance for 30 minutes contemplating what to do and bought a sausage each from the street vendor taking shelter in the next doorway along.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Can Tho\Street.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Can Tho\Vendor.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We eventually ran to a restaurant less than a minute away and still got completely soaked. We had really good spring rolls but the rest of our meal was extraordinarily bland. We also went for coffee and I got to have a good laugh at Alex who was stuck waiting 10 minutes for about 5 ml of coffee to filter. It was really nice though, strong without any bitterness, we're still waiting to find egg coffee.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Can Tho\Coffee.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We stocked up on snacks in case the food options on the island are dire and noticed something really bizarre. Random products are taped together. Are they freebies? Are you forced to buy the two? But who would buy a cereal bar with a can of bbq pringles or a tea towel with a box of cereal. I'm so confused but couldn't find anything when I googled.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex called his friends from home and was obviously in a good mood afterwards because he wouldn't stop trying to wrestle me, or maybe it was the coffee. Either way he couldn't sleep and wouldn't let me try.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="can-tho"> 01-04-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our days have been so full and every experience a new one that I never feel like I'm reflecting on anything. I feel so ignorant and dense some day by filling my eyes up and never my thoughts and I'm frustrated by my writing skills, or lack thereof, but lately it’s just felt like a rush to get everything down before I forget. We're having such a good time. It took a while for me and Alex to settle down and stop knocking heads but things have been so perfect in Cambodia. In fairness we've been doing really well together since Bangkok but getting sick in Laos really brought morale down. Expectations are high for Vietnam and big surprise! We've squeezed in a trip to Taiwan at the end of the month. The flights cost the same with the added trip as going straight to the Philippines and we just couldn't miss the opportunity. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our border crossing today was easy and considerably less corrupt with only one official asking for $1 each, we paid him in our leftover Cambodian Riel which was even better. Our bus journey from the other side was probably the most uncomfortable yet and it hardly mattered that the journey was only 4hrs as they dragged it inevitably out to 6hrs. Can Tho is busier than I expected (it is the 4th largest city in Vietnam) Stranded without money or Internet Alex did a really good job of finding free wifi for us to leech off of to order a taxi online. It felt so strange to be sitting in the back of a car again after a whole month of scooters, tuk tuks, songthaew and the occasional coach or train. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our room is nice, and even sweeter knowing it's £5 a night! There's a cute little courtyard and kitchen, free water and air con.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Can Tho\Homestay.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We walked down a colossal stretch of road which holds the entire city, 10 lanes of traffic down the middle and every business lit up, creating an atmosphere similar to Blackpool but we successfully drew out money and got a sim card so we are all set up again. Slightly worried as two transactions have come out of our bank, despite only one of the cash machines giving us money. We had tried a few ATM's to compare transaction fees and this particular one had said 'transaction successful' but then spat the card out without any cash. Hoping a refund processes in the next few days, if not we'll have to open a dispute with our bank. It is now a source of lingering stress.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We found a place to eat with a small menu entirely in Vietnamese, Google translated the words to 'three eyes' so we just let the server recommend us the meal for 3. We had absolutely no idea what to expect and when she returned with dipping sauces and proceeded to whip up a purple concoction with added sugar, squeezed limes and chili. We were nervous. In the end what arrived was a huge platter of salad leaves, rice, tofu, cucumber and pineapple, thin slices of pork and a crispy mystery meat. She brought over rice paper and as a demonstration rolled me the first spring roll. It was a fun experience for our first meal here and whilst I started to find the taste weird after a while, Alex mopped up the rest and we shared a modest bar of Cadbury's for a sweet treat afterwards.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Today was another incredible day that definitely distinguishes itself as a favourite. We took our scooter and rode up Bokor Hill. We set off early in the harrowing rain, stopped for breakfast and ordered a delectable slice of carrot cake and a brownie to go. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The ride up was almost 2 hours and it rained the entire time. We laughed and got soaked even in our coats and ascended the endlessly winding road at a *safe* pace. The rain along with the clouds and rolling fog made the landscape feel immense and eerie, which suits the trip perfectly as Bokor Hill is littered with buildings abandoned by both the French colonials and later the Khmer Rouge. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Kampot\Wet Road.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Kampot\Wet Us.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">It's a really strange place and I would happily have spent an entire week among the clouds exploring everything given the time. Some buildings are being clumsily refurbished like the huge station house built in 1925, others are left untouched as empty shells showing the death and destruction that took place, and bizarrely there looks to be construction under way for extravagant Swiss style holiday homes. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Kampot\Hotel1.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Kampot\Clouds.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">It was such a shame to see buildings have their history rubbed away with modern refurbishments, the luxury hotels from the 60's telling a story of grandeur and affluence before the Khmer Rouge took over were particularly jarring as they still very much looked abandoned from the outside but had new insides, as though there should be no connection between the two sides! We couldn't imagine who would stay there. Maybe they are trying to revive some of the lost 'thrills' as supposedly bankrupt gamblers would choose between confession in church or oblivion over the casino terrace. We also walked inside the former holiday home of King Sihanouk, and several crumbling temples that maintained an air of dignity. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Kampot\Casino.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Kampot\Church.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Whilst I took pictures, Alex wandered around happily listening to sounds. He became an enthusiastic choir boy in the Catholic Church as the acoustics were phenomenal and spent minutes at a time staring from viewpoints across the jungle listening to the animals and trees. I was worried that in a haunting, nature would reclaim him. However I think he would still consider the real highlight to be when I stacked it at the bottom of some stairs and nearly cried over my yellow coat getting muddy. I asked him for a photo to see how bad it was and for some reason he framed me and now I'm about to drop the freshest new hit to top the rap charts. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Kampot\Album1.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Kampot\Album2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Much to Alex's horror and my unrivaled delight I was the one driving back down when we hit cloud banks and visibility reduced to the end of my nose. It was a very fun ride even if Alex did fret and monkeys lined up ready for an ambush. The car in front actually stopped to allow a monkey to throttle his door. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We are now all ready for tomorrow's border hop and rather sad to be leaving Cambodia.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="77">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 30-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We finally paid to get our washing done! How we have coped is a miracle but I have not done a smidge of washing in three weeks and reached the point of desperation where bikini bottoms were poorly substituting underwear and the smell of B.O emanated from the very fabric of Alex's bag. It'll be so nice to start our Vietnam trip smelling fresh.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent the first half of today making full use of all the facilities here, although Alex was evidently not mature enough to go in the jacuzzi as he suctioned his stomach to the bottom vent and stamped a bullseye across his belly. He was so shocked we laughed for ages, I wish I could have taken a picture. We also tried the sauna and then a steam bath. I don't think I will ever complain about humidity again! I was 2 drops away from breathing water. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We then hired a bike and went into town, had more delicious food and got our bus tickets for crossing the border. Then we enjoyed drinks on a rooftop bar. It was a very lucky night as we both won on the beer tabs! With the cans of Cambodia, Angor and Ganzberg you can win 50% off or a free can if the underside of your beer tab has a number 1 or 2. It’s a fun little game and explains why on the snorkel boat trip on Koh Rong the staff pulled all the tabs for you. </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Kampot\Tab.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We finished the night with a miserable game of darts. Admittedly I was awful but Alex was scarcely any better, taking actual hours to finish a game of around the world. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="kampot"> 29-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Maybe if we hadn't gone to bed so smugly the universe wouldn’t have felt the need to sober us up so violently. We woke in the middle of the night to torrential rain and a thunderstorm that scared us both half to death. It crashed so loud I was sure it had hit a tree and we were about to be crushed. Alex's voice broke in his exclamation and I was preparing a goodbye text for my mum. We were also worried about taking the *vulnerable to capsizing* supply boat in the morning, if we lasted until then.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It didn't even feel like we were being dramatic, it honestly was that scary however by morning and back on the mostly empty supply boat we were able to enjoy clear views as though the storm had all been a manic dream. In Sihanoukville, Alex saved us $2 on a tuktuk by making us walk 30 minutes to the train station instead, bags and all. Doesn't everyone love a Mr Moneypenny? We then had a 3hr wait until the train, which we spent holed up in the only cafe within walking distance. We sat bored and I half intentionally ignored Alex, we then had an argument in which I was admittedly awful, walked in silence to the train station, got shouted abuse at by some mean British guy with a vendetta against backpackers whilst boarding the train, after which I sat down and cried. In hindsight I think I'm due on but that's not the point, I felt awfully guilty and even worse when a little boy came walking down the middle with a smile and a wave, only to stop and stare intently into my eyes. How embarrassing to be caught out by a child! I got a grip, Alex forgave me, the Cambodia countryside was nice and the train unapologetically cut through backstreets busy with people. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The rest of the journey was easy and we arrived at our hostel turned resort and spa in time for dinner. The food was mostly western but surprisingly good, a special appreciation for the pesto pasta and our room is a quaint cottage that Alex describes as a pizza oven with a weaved roof, but don't worry it's not that hot inside.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We’ve spent more time on boats than on land today and it suits me tremendously. A couple of pirates in the making! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Leaving Mad Monkey we had to traipse through water with our bags on, it was nerve wracking but still not as rough as people we saw yesterday wearing jeans and getting soaked up to their waist. Once we got to Dive Shop Cambodia it was smooth sailing *diving*. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our first dive was at a site called Coral at 12 meters, just off the island of Koh Koun. We went down and followed the reef on a really light current that pushed me along at a really nice pace, it was particularly relaxing and I got myself neutrally buoyant and enjoyed drifting along effortlessly. Alex was less comfortable and got frustrated with his trim but after 30 minutes or so our dive master Roth lent us her GoPro! It was so sweet of her and we were immediately excited. I think it really shows our inexperience that armed with a camera for the first time we pointed it at each other before the incredible marine life. I did get some beautiful pictures of sea anemone, they were so fascinating to play with because of how fluid they were. There was a surprising lack of aquatic animals but we did see several schools of tiny fish completely overwhelm the coral like a blanket. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Rong Sanloem\Dive1.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Rong Sanloem\Dive3.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">After an unexpected but warmly received lunch of curry and a hilariously confusing case of miscommunication with Roth about a teleporting sponge, we went to our second dive site called The Back Door. Aptly named as it appeared to offer a backdoor into an unexplored psychedelic universe. Both me and Alex found it too much for my eyes to take in. For the entire 60 minutes we floated wide eyed above an endless floor of coral where not one thing looked the same as another. The long sponges and thin twisted spiral coral gave a real ominous and abandoned feeling to some parts but then the sun would shine down and illuminate everything in a completely different light where it was alive and vibrant. We also saw hundreds of, what I can only describe as, giant eyes watching us from inside the coral, only for them to close with a snap the moment you turn to look. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Rong Sanloem\Dive7.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Rong Sanloem\Dive6.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">I don't believe there is any limit to shape, design or colour for coral. We saw huge bulbous shapes, intricate swirls, sharp edges, lime greens and vivid purple, funnels and gaping mouths, soft tendrils and spikes. I don't have the talent to even begin describing it in any accuracy and I am now a jumbled mess in trying. It was our favourite dive, I am euphoric and grateful, but now even more in love with diving.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Rong Sanloem\Dive2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Rong Sanloem\Dive5.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Junior, one of the senior dive staff  recommended diving in Mozambique, which might be a challenge. He also highly rates the Philippines and Indonesia, and so I pray the budget is fruitful.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Each time we go diving we get just a little bit better, this time I finally used less air than Alex, as I should be for my size. It's incredible how much longer your air lasts when you're no longer taking in every breath like it could be your last. My wetsuit fit like a glove and I felt super comfortable in my own snorkel mask. The boat staff were ready to help in any way possible and Junior was quick to offer tips and give little reminders without making us feel like clumsy beginners. The entire experience was faultless and I already want to go back.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Back on Sanloem, after our dive, we bumped into our shameful Swedes! Marcus was mortified to hear of his antics and accused us of winding him up but it was nice to know he was still in the land of the living and we said our goodbyes. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We hopped on the supply boat again just to get back onto Koh Rong for one night, this time witnessing the boat be emptied in a flurry of organised chaos. I have no idea how everyone knew what they were doing; every slow boat, paddle boat and dinghy flocked towards the supply boat like a makeshift armada. One man would stumble across the length of the boat with a huge block of melting ice over his shoulder, kids were scrambling across with bags of vegetables, people were throwing crates of beer to each other, and building supplies were precariously passed around. It was madness. Alex and I awkwardly shuffled around trying to not get in the way but inevitably did as the entire contents of the boat was gutted. I suppose in a way it was an impressive act of teamwork, as every working man from the island banded together to move everything without so much as a few words. A few kids tried to help too but they were less synchronised and a few gave up in favour of cannonballing off the pier. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Rong Sanloem\Supply Boat.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We arrived at Koh Rong and made a bee line excitedly towards the pizza place (the same one from 3 nights prior run by the two Brits) We booked the 1 night on airbnb for a basic private room, solely for the proximity to good food. We arrived, smiles beaming,
							<br>'You're back!'
							<br>'Yes we are'
							<br>'How was Someleon?'
							<br>'Fantastic'
							<br>'Where are you staying now?'
							<br>Our smiles wavered
							<br> '...here?'
							<br>It quickly transpired that our *stoned* host, Ritchie had no idea about our booking as he forgot the password to his airbnb account, and after the kitchen burnt down 2 weeks ago the spare bedroom has become an impromptu replacement. He recovered the situation just as quickly however by leading us around the back of the property to a tent that we could stay in, free of charge! 
							</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got our refund for the booking and thoroughly enjoyed our extremely cheesy calzones. The day maintained itself as the best day ever and we took a night swim on a little private beach that Ritchie pointed us towards. The bioluminescence wasn't very strong but it was still fun and Alex had me practice free diving with him, which in pitch darkness feels a lot deeper. We liked the idea of staying in a little tent, it looked cozy and different.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Today also marks the first day since leaving home that we have had three square meals. We tucked ourselves in like smug little piggies, ready for bed and feeling very pleased with our day.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Typical that now I start waking up early when there's nothing to do with my day. I was up, showered and ready today by 9am for absolutely no reason.</p>

							</figure>
							<p class="diary-entries">We waited in the restaurant for the 11am boat to take us to the main beach on the island and bumped into David and Marianne again as they were leaving. Marianne also has prescription sunglasses! I had a great time gushing over their revolutionary sight giving abilities with her. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We said bye to Naty on the boat and headed over to the aforementioned dive school to book in for 2 fun dives tomorrow. Very excited but we'll have a busy day checking out, catching the boat, diving and then trying to get the supply boat back to Koh Rong. Are we naive in planning for everything to be on time as Island life so happily thwarts all time keeping. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We frolicked on the beach and enjoyed incredibly calm and clear water until we saw jellyfish. Then we carefully extracted ourselves from the water and counted ourselves lucky. Alex was stricken to find prices no different on the main beach than our hostel, so we returned for our usual rice and noodles. Vietnam Visas have been applied for. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Rong Sanloem\Jellyfish.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We successfully went to bed early, however I have gotten less than 2hrs sleep as true to the nature of party hostels we were all kept awake by Marcus. Now without boyish charm he stumbled, slurred and threw up continuously, but not before he clumsily slapped on the main light to ensure his audience. The helpful reps were also drunk and, under the pretense of sobering him up, acted like even bigger idiots. Without exaggeration, the show lasted all night. I felt so happy to be sober, any remaining appeal of drinking I had was crushed by the image of Marcus bent double over the balcony, dry heaving as his arms swung limply.</p>

						<div id="73">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 26-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex fancied he'd heard a regular pied piper in the night. Apparently we woke up to the scurrying of a thousand rats which were suddenly silenced by one man shouting. Now I don't mean to suggest he imagined it, but nobody else heard anything.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The hostel is completely isolated, our jungle walk the day before was very rogue, generally the only way you can leave is via boat. We spent the day baking under the sun and lounging at the little private beach. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Rong Sanloem\Hut.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">I've nearly finished reading Little Women and we enjoyed rice and noodles again. For the most part though we all complained about being bored. We sat in the restaurant for a while playing games and intermittently trying to plan the next part of our trip and emailing a dive shop.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">At dinner we sat with Naty again and met another couple from Britain, David and Marianne. Sensibly they are only staying for one night, we are feeling trapped by our 2 nights left here. Alex timidly showed off our website and we all spoke about our travels.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="72">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="sanloem"> 25-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Back at the same restaurant from last night for morning pizza and heaps of cheese! Alex got a bacon, sausage and egg barm with brown sauce, we both enjoyed ourselves immensely. We also finally heard the story behind why the supply slow boat is not recommended, as our ex-convict so gladly recounted its many capsizes. Is it a risk we're willing to take for the discount? Unfortunately I think so.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Thankfully today's trip was on a regular slow boat. After a mix up, changing boats and turning up at the same pier we left, we did eventually rock up on the shores of Koh Rong Sanloem, only to be left waiting for our free transfer to the hostel that never arrived. Me, Alex and two Swedes mulled about for 3 hours waiting on the pier before we gave up and tackled the jungle hike. I am learning to despise carrying my backpack. We arrived dripping with sweat to a half hearted apology and checked in.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The hostel looks and feels like an American summer camp, with sandy floors, wooden cabins and bikini clad girls. The only place with WiFi is the restaurant bar that has 4 long benches and does not cease to play club music. The showers are cold. I promise I am still trying to keep an open mind.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We share our cabin with the Swedes, Marcus and Karl, and an Austrian girl, Naty. We all ate dinner together (me and Alex opted for the two cheapest meals on the menu, can you guess? Noodles and Rice!) The event for tonight, much to Alex's delight was a pub quiz. We all teamed up, called ourselves 'The Big Fact Hunt' and once again won! I will concede that we did get some help from the Swedish rep who wanted to help his fellow compatriots. Our prize was matching tank tops which we wore with utter embarrassment. Alex felt like a woman, whilst I felt like a little boy, but all in good spirit we got a group picture. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Rong Sanloem\Quiz Team.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We drank together, Alex patiently explained the rules to playing fives but Karl was drunk and dopey already. We had a little dance and gloated over being the 'smartest people here'. We had fun, Naty is funny in a very understated way, and Alex has warmed to the Swedes. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 24-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Boat trip! We went on a snorkel-fishing-beach-BBQ-sunset-plankton tour. It was 7 hours so it filled up the day nicely, although we were worried when, after loading everyone in, the boat got stuck on the sand and we had to all get out and help push. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We saw funny looking coral and crystal clear water. We were completely unsuccessful in fishing but were rewarded with a BBQ of fish and chicken regardless and the sunset was brilliant. The only disappointment really was the bioluminescence, it just wasn't very bright or abundant, you had to swim down to see it but that in itself is terrifying as you easily get disorientated and muddle up from down in the pitch black, especially Alex who has really utilised his freediving training. I just accept now that in deep water I will lose sight of him quickly. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">For dinner we treated ourselves to pizza made with real cheese! I had a calzone which was even better. We spoke to a *minor* celebrity that featured on banged up abroad. It was funny, we said we were from Warrington and he replied knowingly 'ah I stayed in Risley...prison'. He was quick to reassure us he isn't a real criminal, but was just unfortunate to get caught smuggling drugs into Japan. I can't fault him though, he said the food would be good and it really was.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">For anyone keeping up to date we're going to Koh Rong Someleon tomorrow for 3 nights which doesn't have a lick of WIFI or plug sockets apparently, so updates will surely be delayed. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="70">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="koh-rong"> 23-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We have someone or something to thank for today. We woke up perfectly on time to get breakfast at Rocks and were greeted with smiles and our names already committed to memory. Treated like old friends we ordered French toast and pancakes which of course were delicious and then we rushed off to get a tuk tuk to the bus company.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We have never, not here or at home, gotten on a nicer coach or been treated so well! Our seats fully reclined and came with power outlets. We were the only people on there and the assistant came over to explain our journey, provide the WiFi password and offer us water. Absolutely unprecedented. The 6 hours were a breeze.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Arriving in Sihanoukville, we then had to awkwardly explain that we weren't going to the main pier to catch the commercial ferry but were going to get the supposed 'not trusted or safe' slow boat for a fifth of the price. After some trepidation we got on the slow boat and tucked ourselves in among mattresses, water bottles, Jerry cans and Styrofoam trays. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">From the boat we took a bike taxi to our airbnb, riding pillion and trying not to grab onto the Cambodian men as we lurched up hills. I stood back as the bike was refuelled with, from what I could tell, Mountain Dew so it's no wonder the bike struggled so much. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The island seems very rural and...rustic, and so naturally our room does not have ac, hot water or a sink (an added note: the shower head, taken off the wall, does not reach above Alex's shoulder). Alex was stressed from haggling the price of our taxi bikes down from a whooping $20 and so upon seeing our room and the missing sink was pushed over the edge and threw a tantrum throwing soap across the room, he got over himself eventually, we went for food, and here he is enjoying himself playing with local kids on the beach. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It's all in a day's work :)</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 22-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our morning got off to a roaring start with ice coffee, carrot cake and a warmed up cinnamon bun. It was everything we hoped it would be, however the day we had planned was much more sombre. With only 2 nights booked in Phnom Penh, we visited first the S-21 Prison and then the Choeung Ek Genocidal Center. It does feel inappropriate to say we enjoyed the day but it was interesting and a valuable experience. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had headsets on at the killing fields which offered a lot of context, but it was particularly difficult to look at a seemingly innocent tree and learn that it was the object that so many infants and children were killed against. Alex was most moved by the photographs displayed in the prison and we had the opportunity to meet one of only four child survivors of the prison and buy his signed book. We also looked at an incomprehensible amount of human skulls. Naturally I didn't take any pictures.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I feel slightly ashamed at how little I knew about the Khmer Rouge and the atrocities they had committed, and to learn how recent the events took place! Although that being said, the modern world is still not absolved of such evils. I think it will be worthwhile to learn a little more about the history of the countries that we're visiting, especially when the effects can still be felt today. Here's a fact I learnt recently: there are still around 80 million unexploded bombs left in Laos that continue to pose a risk to residents.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It feels wrong to talk about anything else from today now, but Alex believes the Riel deserves some appreciation as the 'prettiest notes' now that he has 1 of everything (the 2,000 note is missing from the photo however, because it was tattered). </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Phnom Penh\Currency.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We also had quite possibly the best food in the whole of Cambodia. We went to a little place called 'Pu Rock Cafe' sharing 3 meals and thoroughly enjoying each one. We tried Amok Curry and both dubbed it the best curry we have ever had, then we had an utterly delectable beef and cheese sandwich and then an unusual dish of stir fried mango with chicken which was also delicious. Rock, the owner, sat down with us for a chat and impressed us with his knowledge on football, the inbetweeners, British politics and some funny idioms like 'lovely jubbly' and 'see you later alligator'. Alex had a brain lapse and failed to return 'In a while crocodile'. We're hoping we can wake up early enough tomorrow and go back for breakfast before our bus journey to Koh Rong.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Phnom Penh\Food.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We watched the Top Gear episode from Vietnam to 'get inspired' but I think really Alex is just testing me to see if I'm 'bro' material. I think I have passed :)</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="68">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="phnom-penh"> 21-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Another awful bus journey listening to a cacophony of tik tok sounds at competing levels on the bus. After 8 hours it really started to test our patience and the entire journey was without air con, breathing in the same musty air as the driver meandered his way to our destination at a leisurely pace, stopping every 20 minutes to fanny about and socialise. It was stifling. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Arriving in Phnom Penh we showered and walked our monstrous appetites down the road, where we abruptly stopped as the insane traffic and my moment's hesitation made Alex completely lose his nerve over crossing the road. He stormed back to our airbnb in a rage, I stayed on the street hesitating over whether to concede and give up but then seeing Alex's head fretfully appear over our balcony softened my mood and I messaged him words of encouragement and did my best to reassure him that the street was not an immediate death sentence. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We did eventually go back out together, getting food and stocking up on much needed water. Our efforts were rewarded by the universe in the blessed form of salt and vinegar pringles, I couldn't believe it after nearly 3 months searching. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">To earn extra brownie points with Alex and keep him sweet I did some preliminary F1 studying in the evening so that I can be his bro as well as his girlfriend during this season.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="#mar-week3"> 20-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Woke up at the ungodly hour of 4am just to stand around for over an hour looking at Angkor Wat in the dark waiting for sunrise. I'd like to say it was worth it in the end but I'm not entirely convinced. Maybe if we had paid for a guide we would have gotten a little more out of the trip, however I did overhear one little nugget of info 'Angkor means city and Wat a Buddhist temple so the name translates to City Temple' which explains why it’s so huge.</p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Siem Reap\Lighter.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to 6 different sites in total and shared our tuk tuk with a Canadian couple who were really friendly and interesting. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The Fireflies were stunning and hovered about everywhere and I did really enjoy one particular site that had trees growing through the ruins. Alex talked alot about Minecraft which was unexpected, think he's itching to watch a speed build of Angkor Wat now in creative mode. We also found giant helicopters! (the seeds that have 2 leaves extending like wings and when you throw them they spin down). We had fun throwing them off platforms and watching them spin and race each other. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We got back around 12 and immediately had the nap that we promised not to, then in the evening took advantage of the empty pool whilst everyone else was predrinking. I expected Alex to be more self conscious but he was goofing around like usual in water. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Happy mothers day!</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Today has been easy breezy and exactly what we needed it to be. Despite staying in a dorm room, we both slept incredibly well and were ready to put yesterday behind us. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got our usual drinks order of ice coffee and Thai tea whilst we found somewhere for a late breakfast. We tried Beef lok lak which was incredible, the meat was so tender with the juiciest fried egg.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Siem Reap\Beek Lak.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we ran some errands; booked our sunrise trip to Angkor Wat for tomorrow, got our bus tickets for Phnom Penh and our next airbnb stay, and made a rough plan for the next week along with organising our Vietnam Visa. Boxes were ticked.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we lounged around the rooftop pool and read our books under the sun and finally a clear blue sky, but the real highlight of the day was going to a little place called 'creative bar & springrolls' doesn't it already sound promising? </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We sat in a garden playing games and sipping an ever so fancy cocktail named 'Lavender Bloom' and waiting with great anticipation for our spring rolls. Here's the line up: Fresh rolls made with tomato, sun dried tomato, mozzarella, pesto with an Italian dressing, and fried rolls filled with slow cooked beef, caramelised onion and cheddar cheese. They were an absolute experience. Phenomenal! Incomparable to any other spring roll, a culinary experience! I also trounced Alex at Hanamikoji and Rummikub so it was an extra great time for me ;) </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Siem Reap\Spring Rolls.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">After that we walked around, got smoothies, got more food, got more drinks, oh and I bought some yellow pants! A purchase I vehemently justified as they are much more lightweight than my other pants and more convenient than both my long skirts. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Cambodia has quickly redeemed itself.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="siem-reap"> 18-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our journey started early and was perfectly regular until we suddenly arrived at the border crossing and were spat out of our minivan. The border looked so unsuspecting I think even the building was surprised to bear the title. The 100m stretch looked dusty and completely abandoned, Alex even commented on the singular distant ring from a cow bell. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Now, one would assume a passport, E-visa and a bright smile would be plenty to cross a border with, but apparently every official you meet expects a bribe. Every. Single. One. And they'd prefer that to be in the form of crisp US dollar bills.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had to give all of our remaining 94,000 Kip (approx £5) to receive our stamp out of Laos. Then we had to scrounge around and find our leftover Thai Baht to pay 100 baht to the official checking our arrival form, then 200 baht to an angry official that stamped our passports and then held onto them with an iron grip until he got the money.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Siem Reap\Border Building.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Siem Reap\Border Crossing.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We then got harassed by officials on motorbikes to 'leave immediately' once we were through and made to repeatedly show our bus ticket. Not quite the warm welcome into Cambodia that we were hoping for. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Penniless and without a sim card we listened to the same tune played on a loop from some psychopaths phone whilst the minivan filled up again and we were off. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">A not so quick 8hrs later we arrived in Siem Reap. I've managed to read 45% of Little Women and Alex should be on track to becoming the next Chess GrandMaster.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We are now well equipped with US Dollar, Riel and a Sim card, freshly showered and deliciously fed. My feet are swollen beyond recognition and Alex has proclaimed the journey 'the worst one yet'. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Onwards and upwards!</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="64">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="pakse"> 17-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were shaken out of the night bus at 9am having arrived but with nowhere to go. We couldn't check in to the airbnb until 2pm.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I brushed my teeth in an outdoor sink by some public toilets and brushed my hair then we dropped our bags off with our host and went to kill time in a cafe. The morning felt long and uninspired, with nothing in Pakse really taking our interest.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our hosts were lovely and helped us book our bus tickets for the morning to Siem Reap, a journey across the border into Cambodia which will take 10 hours plus. Alex enjoyed another awful meal and then we had a panic to try and print out our E-visas which apparently was necessary however inconvenient. Our host once again stepped in and walked us over to a printer shop that would be open in the morning. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Pakse\Alex Pakse.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">All problems being solved, but with our room for the night smelling like mouldy feet and our tap water possibly smelling worse, we went back outside to walk around the meagre night market which led us into the 'friendship mall' which was equally small but had a Dairy Queen! We got a brownie blizzard which was handed to me upside down, presumably to show off its thick ice-cream like consistency. It was nice, especially in the warm still air of the evening. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Tomorrow will no doubt be a long day.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="63">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 16-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Biggest day travelling since coming here. We spent 5 hours on a bus to Vientiane, got a taxi to another bus station and waited there 3 hours to get our first night bus which will take us to Pakse. Dinner was a feast of Pringles, chicken flavoured peanuts and miniature sponge cakes. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The night bus was cosy, two people squished into a single bed, thank god I had Alex because I cannot imagine lying that close to a stranger. We crammed our small backpacks between our legs and used one duvet for a pillow and the other to cover us. We couldn't sit upright but It was actually fairly comfortable...until the bus started moving. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I didn't sleep at all, but I felt really relaxed and could sort of let my thoughts go muddy and get lost in my head for 20 minutes at a time before I resurfaced into full consciousness. The roads were awful, we hurtled down a dirt path for well over an hour at one point. Alex slept happily and increasingly squashed me against the window.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I thought checking the time might be discouraging so instead I laid down with my face pressed against the window all night watching the odd sleeping town go past. Mostly I looked out at nothing, just an unlit mystery beyond a roadside shrub or tree. I did see one fire; a small farm, the flames low and rolling. It wasn't really so bad and the time went quickly.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Typically it wasn't until daylight that I fell asleep. The bus journey took 13 and a half hours in total.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="62">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 15-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Today felt like a spare day so we spent it lazily in the knowledge that the next 24hrs would be heavy on the traveling.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went back to Blue Lagoon 4 but somehow repeatedly missed the sign to turn off. By the time we did eventually make it to the Lagoon, the journey time had nearly doubled and then Alex realised he'd forgotten his swim shorts. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I suggested he swim in his kecks and let the sun see a little more thigh but he looked mortified by the idea when we saw other people there. I had a good giggle over the situation. We both just relaxed and read our books. Alex bought some crisps but got more enjoyment from feeding the fish than eating them himself. We played games, I lay in a rubber ring, it was nice.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We've noticed that unlike Thailand where every dog was a mongrel and had the same look about it, here in Laos you see all types of dogs. Today we found an Enzo (I couldn't get a picture of him quick enough as we rode past) but we're still on the look out for a Meeko. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex was very happy at dinner with his Goats cheese and baguette. I wish I could have experienced the same elation as I also desperately miss cheese but my taste isn't as refined as Alex's. He was very happy and drank both the mulberry juice and mulberry smoothie. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Vang Vieng\Goats Cheese.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">I had coconut ice cream from the market to cheer myself up from yet another disappointing meal in Laos. I'm having no luck with food.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Last thing I know Alex will want me to mention, as he's been getting very passionate over the subject, safe road use. He has unlocked a new biggest pet peeve which is people indicating to turn left, but pulling up on the right. It gets to him every time as he hesitates in limbo on whether to drive past or hold back in case they cut across. I love it, I laugh wickedly over his shoulder waiting for the left indicators, just knowing everyone will do the same thing and drive him mad. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">The air seemed clearer (Air visual confirmed it was in fact still the same as before) but everything looked so much brighter and greener. The views whilst driving around today were breathtaking.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We once again underestimated a hike and were ill prepared and not dressed appropriately (sundress and sandals combo) ...I also forgot to screw the lid on the water bottle so it tipped over and spilled out when Alex went to pick it up, so he was impatient with me AND thirsty but happy days by the end! We reached the summit and took cool pictures on the very gimmicky motorbike that was staged at the top. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Vang Vieng\Mountain Top.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Vang Vieng\Bike Mountain.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we went on another long drive to Blue Lagoon 3 which was much busier than Lagoon 4 with a shop and dozens of benches filled with people. Alex felt intimidated by the amount of people and I was nervous about swinging off the zipline so in the end we didn't go in. In hindsight we should have pushed ourselves but it felt like a long day already so we just sat on the edge eating a giant chocolate chip scone that had been disguised in the bakery as a cookie.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Vang Vieng\Blue Lagoon.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">On the way back Alex pulled a real doozy. He turned the wrong way and nearly drove straight off the end of the road. There were 'road works' aka. Men digging and the road ahead abruptly ended with a 5 meter drop and Alex was about to just keep going. Very uncharacteristic of him to be so dopey but then he did it again! He got confused and went the wrong way just 2 minutes around the corner from where we were staying! Even I knew the right way at that point. I'll have to keep an eye on him, we can't both be blind and directionless.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">There were thunderstorms all through the night which made the weather today gloomy and <i>almost</i> a little chilly. I also found the app AirVisual which helpfully monitors air quality in your area. Vang Vieng is in the red zone at 167 US AQI, health recommendations include: avoid outdoor exercise, close windows, wear a mask outside and run an air purifier. For reference London is at 30 US AQI. So that's exciting! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We rented a scooter for a couple days and explored the countryside. We saw an old Man walking with umbrellas in place of walking sticks, lots of cattle in the road, people waving and saying hello, and one little girl who looked absolutely disgusted after looking at our faces.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We made a trip to Kaeng Nyui Waterfall. Reviews had warned that in dry season the waterfall might be dried up, but we thought surely not with last night's storm?...</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">The scenery was still gorgeous and whilst it was hard not to be bitter about the foreboding ever-present fog that veiled every limestone cliff and mountain, it did add a touch of apocalyptic wander to the ride. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We were the only visitors at Blue Lagoon 4 (there's 6 lagoons in total, named in order of their discovery) and despite the cooler temperature I still managed to wrangle Alex into a rubber ring with me. We didn't play on the zip wire or rope swing but I'm hoping we have a chance to go back on a hotter day.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">The ride back added another mark to the tally of bike accidents we've witnessed, this time a dog got clipped. The dog cried alot and made a big fuss but I actually think he was okay in the end, he limped for a bit but was running by the time we rode passed. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 12-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">I think after trying so hard just to get through yesterday we've now fallen apart. Alex is having a crisis over everything, and I'm still feeling a little tender and sorry for myself.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went out for food but it was ill inspired and Vang Vieng feels nothing like Luang Prabang even if the two place names share a similar cadence. The walk back did however deliver brief happiness as we saw hot air balloons! At first just one rising above the few buildings but then it was joined by 2 others. It was wonderful, I don't think I'd actually seen hot air balloons before. Although I imagine the view from above leaves much to be desired as the fog is so thick you can't see the surrounding mountains or sky.</p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Vang Vieng\Lots of Balloons.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We miss home cooking alot, it's hitting us hard today. I'm worried that without some warm buttery crumpets I'll waste away over here but I think Alex would prefer weetabix with honey and cold milk. We're going to implement a veto on bringing up the topic with each other from now on because in the wrong mood it sends us both into a manic spiral of sunday dinner fantasies, cheddar cheese and Cadbury's chocolate.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="vang-vieng"> 11-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Woke up immediately feeling like something was off. Went to the toilet, confirmed my insides had liquefied then collapsed back into bed feeling awful and worried about the day.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I slept all morning so wasn't actually feeling too bad when it came to packing up our bags, I made it down the road to where Alex had a songthaew waiting for us, we dropped our bags off at the travel agents and nipped to grab a quick drink. I ordered an iced lemon tea and actually really enjoyed it but then things started going south again very quickly. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I was seeing stars on the walk back to the travel agents, I left Alex to load up all of our bags into the minivan transfer. Then I was sat in my seat sweating profusely, light headed and shaking in the familiar ‘I’m going to pass out' feeling. It felt like the journey to the train station took ages too. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We arrived and I miraculously was able to stand up and walk 100 metres to the line for security (bizarrely they put your bags through a scanner like at the airport). Alex once again had ALL of our bags, I couldn't even see at this point my vision had gone completely grey and I kept weakly begging Alex 'I can't do it' and then we were waiting in the line, I was slumped against the wall and when it was time to move up I passed out. Came back around to a sea of Asian faces peering over me as they walked around me in the queue. Alex didn't look that stressed but his whole face was sweating. We got to queue jump to the front and passed through security quickly, thankfully the brief loss of consciousness seemed to perk me up and I made it onto the train, but not before taking a trip to the bathroom and having to use the dreaded squat toilet. Had to be the worst hour of my life.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">On a completely different note, guess who we saw on the train platform? Georainbolt! How cool is that, Alex was too shy to say hi and I was still floppy and grey so I didn't attempt an introduction either, but on the train Alex got friendly with the guy sat next to him and told him who was on the train with us, who then started to shout down the train carriage 'Geo Guesser'. He turned around and gave them a little wave. When it was time for us to get off Alex, now being all suave, said 'Keep it up' and Geo Guesser replied 'Appreciate it man'. We don't know Georainbolt’s real name, but isn't that so cool.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The airbnb seems nice but it does smell quite badly outside of burning and it's still very smoggy in the air. March to April is burning season here when the farmers burn their fields. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I slept fitfully all night, and Alex went out for food without me. I made him take pictures of his meal so I didn't feel too left out. Alex here: I clearly chose to eat like a child and take pictures like a child but this meal along with rice and a sprite did only cost £3, isn’t a meal deal more now?</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Our sleep pattern is a mess, we were awake until 4:30am but it's our last chance to go to Kuang Si Waterfall today so with only 4 hours sleep, we dragged ourselves up and out.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got to the waterfalls and had 15 minutes of relative peace to enjoy the views before the tours started turning up and dumping people out in hoards.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We missed nearly every photo opportunity but to set a camera up on the edge, or have Alex get out and take a picture to then get back in would have really taken away from the experience. I think there's something really sobering about seeing influencer types spend so much of their time somewhere just trying to get 'perfect' content. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">One woman at the waterfall jumped in the pool at the bottom of the waterfall, did a lot of smiling and arm waving, then waded back in, snatched the camera from her husband, viewed the footage with dissatisfaction and got straight out. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It was worse at the cafe the other day. There was a women who didn't even sit to enjoy a drink but turned up, pushed people out of her shot, made a van move up the street out of her way, fiddled with her tripod, then proceeded to sit at different tables in the cafe, then pose on somebody else's scooter before moving onto the next location. We saw her hours later on a different street doing the same things. It's such a shame, for the content creator and their followers, but I suppose I'm guilty too of consuming the picture perfect travel content online.Anyway! Here’s our pictures </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Big Waterfall.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We walked to the top of the biggest waterfall for some nice viewpoints and found picnic benches and more tranquil pools of water. There was a group of young school kids playing in the largest pool along with some tourist volunteers that had at least 3 kids clung onto them at any given time. It was nice up there though, we swam and played cards before walking back down and giving a lot of people reassurance that no, the walk isn't too long. </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Waterfall Top.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We also went to the endangered Bear sanctuary close by. It wasn't very big but it had Sun and Moon bears that had been rescued from poachers. All the bears seemed happy and active and you could get relatively close from the observation deck.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Bears1.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Bears2.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Back in town we booked a train to Vang Vieng for tomorrow. Initially we thought we would go via coach as it’s cheaper but after reading a slew of awful reviews that made it sound like actual hell we opted for the slow train at 4:30.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex has not perked up to his usual eating capacity so for dinner we just ordered a side of loaded nachos from a bar. There was no promised melted cheese, instead there was a hazardous glowing yellow sauce over everything with absolutely no taste. Very suspicious, and no guacamole or salsa but only pickles. Very disappointing end to the day.</p>

						<div id="56">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 09-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex woke up feeling better, we headed into town for food and then he very quickly didn't feel better anymore. My mum told him to eat something plain, Alex ordered a pulled pork panini, he then also ate most of my pancakes because I don't like chocolate sauce. I shouldn't laugh but it was comical watching the fear in his eyes as he tried to keep the nausea at bay in the middle of a nice cafe. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I took some pictures of the streets as I realised riding on the bike previously I hadn't stopped to take any. We were planning to walk up Phousi Hill for sunset but Alex was feeling too sick and wanted to get back to the safety of a toilet.</p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Erin Lamppost.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We've had to rearrange our plans and skip the day volunteering at the school, really hoping he feels well enough to visit Kuang Si waterfall tomorrow but if not I know our next stop in Vang Vieng has plenty of natural beauty to look at.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">This morning was the easiest move we've done yet. We woke up and dragged our bags not even 100m, it's a good job too because Alex is really sick.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">He was fine last night but since waking up he hasn't stopped throwing up. Last thing he ate was all the jackfruit yesterday so he's just throwing up the water he drinks and then dry heaving, it sounds awful. I don’t know how to help and I feel really useless.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Spent 2 hours on the phone to my mum panicking whilst Alex lay on the bed like a wet blanket, eventually got him to take paracetamol and then a dioralyte which has perked him up a little now but God it’s been a long day.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="54">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 07-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We have actual clean clothes! Our host Chanti let us use an industrial sized washing machine free of charge. We filled the machine up and added powder and softener but couldn't get the machine to fill with water. We sent her a message and left for the day and when we came back she'd washed and hung it all to dry for us! We felt awful, especially after loading it up with literally all of our clothes. We needed to use a key to unlock the water tap apparently. We made sure to thank her but it still felt like too much.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">In town I read the front page of the China Daily. Very interesting, I read about China's commendable efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict by providing a win-win proposal for both nations, denying the 'Western propaganda about the so-called preferential treatment of China towards Russia'. I'd love an excuse to analyse the different literary devices used.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Chinese Paper.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">In the cafe I lost the battle for Alex's attention to a couple of rubik's cubes, or rather one rubik’s cube and one megaminx. Needless to say the self appointed puzzle master solved them both easily.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Alex Cubing.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We walked around and looked in some antique and craft shops again and then met Chanti and Yoxa (our other host) back at the airbnb so they could show us around 2 other rooms as we had wanted to extend our stay but they didn't have availability. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I think we'll stay in the tree house next door, the bottom floor is completely open and the upstairs has a balcony around the front and a tree growing through the middle. It's lovely. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Chanti let us pick mulberries from her tree and gave us some sliced mango with a sachet of spice that we naturally tried and hated. She also gave Alex some more of the mystery fruit he accepted from her the previous night. Took a while to figure out what it was but we've concluded it's jackfruit. I think it tastes unnaturally sweet and the smell is quite sickly but Alex ate it all.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We rode our bikes to the night market. I bought a sarong and crocket top, Alex did some tentative bartering to get the price down. We had a bowl of noodles and afterwards whilst I enjoyed some mini coconut pancakes Alex bought even more jackfruit.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="mar-week1"> 06-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We woke up and went out on the bicycles. Mine doesn't have working breaks and Alex's can't change gear so his legs are spinning around like billy-o whilst moving at a slow walking pace. We still had a great time and the ride into the 'city centre' only took 15 minutes. The 'city' is the size and atmosphere of a quaint town and the French influence is balanced really nicely. The roads aren't super busy like nearly everywhere else we've been so riding our bikes around is relaxing even if we have to remember to ride on the other side.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to a cafe overlooking the Mekong and then paid the small toll to walk across the bamboo bridge. The bridge has to be rebuilt every year after wet season because the water rises too high and washes it away. It was surprisingly bouncy.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Erin View Cafe.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The other side of the bridge is considered the countryside and has some really impressive workshops and stores. We met one lady who was working on a huge wooden loom and sold gorgeous woven fabrics and silk. I bought a scarf that I'm obsessed with but absolutely terrified to wear in case it gets ruined. She packaged it for me in handmade paper with pressed flowers. We also went into one shop and were shown a painting that had been done using sand.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Back in town we of course had to try Laos Beer which we both really enjoyed, probably not a coincidence though that Alex enjoys the cheapest beer on the menu.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Erin Beer.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we finished the day off by volunteering at a bookshop that invites English speaking foreigners inside to have conversations with Laos teens that are learning English so that they can practice their speaking skills. It was really interesting. I spoke to Maoui who is the same age as me and also likes the colour yellow. She complimented my nose and thought I looked really young. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">She told me about her friends and family, and asked how I collect memories so I told her about the website and showed her my bracelet that has recently acquired the bead for Laos. We had a really good chat because her English was almost fluent and we could relate to each other even if our experiences were so different. I don't think I've taken enough time during our travels to truly think and appreciate how privileged I am. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Meanwhile Alex had a chat with a younger boy and had street view up on Google to show him his house. I think their conversations were more limited but the boy was really interested in finding out about Alex's life.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="luang-prabang"> 05-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">The flight to Laos by far had to be the easiest airport experience me or Alex have ever had. There was nobody at the check-in desk but the staff and barely a line for security. Once in the airport, we waddled over to the gate and pretty much boarded immediately. The plane was the size of a bus which terrified me and thrilled Alex. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Lao Plane.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex got us to have a good look around at all of the jumbo jets before we left because it’ll ‘be a while until we see any again’. I tried my best to feign enthusiasm. Lao Airlines, pulling out all of the stops, can you believe on a 2 hour flight we were served food. A modest sandwich and super sweet yoghurt but appreciated nonetheless. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Getting to the Airbnb was easy, just got a taxi where Alex sat upfront giving the driver directions. First impressions look good, our host had left some rice cakes, sweet biscuit lattice and some really nice sweet-pea tea.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Luang Airbnb.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Luang Prabang\Luang Treats.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Can’t comment too much on the neighbourhood, we fell asleep almost immediately on arrival for the remainder of the day only waking up after sunset where we tried in vain to find somewhere to eat and said Sawaidee (hello) back to every single person we passed in the street. As a result, we do not get the impression that Luang Prabang is particularly touristy. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Side note: we drew out 2,500,000 Kip which came out in a massive wad of 25 individual 100,000 notes which felt insane but was only £125. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Even less interesting side note: while in Thailand it seems the pound increased in value significantly over Thai Baht as when previously £300 got us 11,200, it most recently got us 12,300.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">As planned, I spent the day mostly doing work..vastly underestimated how long it would take me. But I had Alex beside me to help motivate and distract. Here’s the view from the cafe, felt really appreciative of my life and the opportunities that have come my way.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Cafe View.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex was supposed to work on the website and implement some changes, however he mostly spent the time teaching himself online chess (which he’s still really bad at).</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Alex Cafe.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Overall, the day passed quickly with not too much to say aside from some really good crispy pork with unlimited soup for dinner.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 03-03-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We moved hostel <i>again</i>, however this time it feels very worth it. We’re in the suburbs staying in a beautifully maintained old house that’s attached to a modern and bright cafe. The french windows at the end of the bed overlook the garden and fill the room with natural sunlight, and we were offered a free drink from the cafe when we arrived. It’s lovely, I'm actually excited to wake up early tomorrow and find myself a cosy little spot downstairs to do my work. I’ve been really fortunate to be offered some freelance work from my previous job, and here feels like the perfect place to do it. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It’s a shame we can’t stay longer but if it wasn't already apparent we stayed in Koh Tao far longer than we initially planned, with the 45 days visa running out soon we won’t have time to visit northern Thailand which means our next stop after here is Laos! Alex is extra excited because we chose to save ourselves 2 x 10hr bus journeys and fly straight from Bangkok to Luang Prabang. We’ll be in a Lao Airlines ATR 42/72, I’ve been shown a picture already, it looks… like a plane. Apparently it's most likely going to be the first propeller plane I’ll have flown on, which is fun? The flight’s only 2hrs so I won't be complaining anyway. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We found somewhere close by to get our visa photos taken and I won't pretend to be modest, I think the photos came out incredibly well! I think some photoshopping might have occurred on the sly because no visa or passport picture is ever supposed to come out looking that good. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Passport Picture.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to a restaurant whilst we waited for the photos to develop. Super cute place where we got Thai tea, ice coffee and ‘volcano roti’ which was a surprise. I’m not sure what we expected volcano to taste like but spicy condensed milk wasn't it. We went back to the same place for dinner and had a really good meal.                   </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">The heat is unbearable and after waking up and taking our first anti-malarial tablet we both felt really nauseous. It’s really difficult to find the motivation to go out and explore the city, getting around is difficult since the buses are unreliable, there’s a huge area not covered by trains and taxis are only cheap if you opt for a passenger seat on a scooter, which Alex doesn’t feel comfortable with. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Unsurprisingly then it was food that motivated us to get out of bed, we met Bart outside of Thipsamai for what was supposedly the best and oldest pad thai in Thailand, with a history of serving the dish going back to 1939. It was underwhelming, and we both agree the pad thai in Krabi is by far still the best we’ve had. </p>

We went and had a really nice time. We found Thai tea ice cream to try, and Alex won me two prizes on the shooting game. I also had a few goes but was less successful. I’ve already attached the strange mice to our bags, but the nose has fallen off mine already!</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">In the evening we met back up with Bart to visit the stunning rooftop bar at Vertigo. We drank pina coladas and spoke freely overlooking the city scape that was lit up in the night. It was a really nice night, Bart was too kind and paid for all of the drinks and only let us repay him with a bowl of cheap noodles at the end of the night. We almost got pulled in for a ping-pong show several times where I fear Alex would have been eaten alive. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We painfully moved hostels in the morning to a cheaper and supposedly better located one. It took us 3 hours! All because the bus kicked everyone off mid journey, so we then had to walk to another bus stop to wait for a different bus. We stood waiting in 37 degrees heat with our backpacks plastered to us, dripping with sweat. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After already waiting a while, a little old man became friendly with us so we sat speaking to him for over an hour whilst we waited. His English wasn’t perfect but we muddled through a few conversations. He told us he had spent a lot of time working in New York, and showed us his New Jersey driving license. He helped us get the right bus, which coincidentally was the same one he was waiting for, and he bought us ice cream! It was so sweet, I sat next to him on the bus and caught him listening to Taylor Swift ‘Love Story’ such a softie. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We passed through the Khao San Road again to grab cheap quick food. It was already starting to get busy even in the daylight. A man tried to hassle Alex into having a suit made and used the very original line ‘Long hair, long life, happy happy wife’. I flashed him a big smile.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We nearly got run over by 1,000 scooters as we were crossing 5 lanes of traffic. The <i>helpful</i>walking green man light at the crossing decided to abandon us mid way and the bikes didn’t wait a second longer. I think if I'd have been on my own I would have froze but Alex dragged us across. A precursor to Vietnam I suppose.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We accidentally stumbled into a peaceful protest whilst waiting for our taxi to meet Bart at the cinema. Large banners read ‘Thailand is not beautiful’ and ‘Free all political prisoners’. In the taxi we drove past the riot police getting ready. It’s worth reading about the situation if you’re interested but I won’t go into any details.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Bart had two delicious pieces of chicken waiting for us, and he’d already got our tickets. We watched ‘The Whale’. It was shown in English with Thai subtitles. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend the film, it wasn’t an enjoyable watch, however the salted popcorn and air conditioned room made it comfortable. Before the film came on there was a 5 minute slideshow in homage to the King where you would expect film trailers. It certainly made an impression on us, I’m just not sure it was the one they intended. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I was really excited when I saw red bean taiyaki being sold in the food court. I bought one and finally got to pretend just for a few bites that I was in an anime, however I didn’t actually enjoy the bean texture with such a sweet taste, so naturally Alex gobbled it up for me. That was it for the day, we said goodbye to Bart again and we walked home, stopping by China town for some average noodles.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We are bad travelers and once again slept in until late morning. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got food at Bamee kon sae Lee (thong lo) which was a small portion, a seemingly common trend here, but the crispy pork was incredible. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went out in search of a camera shop that stocked the dive case we need for our 360 camera but spoiler alert: we walked 26,000 steps, visited two colossal shopping malls, and didn't buy ANYTHING! We didn't even leave Sukhumvit Road! All day walking down One. Single. Road. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Maybe I should have treated myself to one of the *expensive* wet suits in Billabong to soften the blow. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Big Building Street.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Coupley Park.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We did visit two parks which were nice. Went to Benchakitti Park at golden hour and walked along a pedestrian bridge overlooking the unglamorous residential area of Bangkok whilst skyscapers crowded the sky. I think the juxtaposition speaks for itself.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Slum.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Green Walkway.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we wandered into Lumphini Park and saw this beastly creature joining in on a park run. Nobody else seemed even a little bit phased and he crossed the path in no rush minding his own business. What in the world even is it!?</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Big Lizard.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Bangkok Sunset.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Dinner was disappointing, we found a modest looking restaurant that boasted Michelin recognition and the 'best chicken rice'. It was a half portion of plain rice with plain chicken. I read Google reviews afterwards and everyone was raving about how good it was! Am I being gaslighted or are we actually wrong in thinking it was tasteless?</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Anyhow mango sticky rice and thai tea cheered us up and gave us the much needed energy to get back. It’s been a really, really long day.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex has taken to singing in the evening, or sometimes just making random noises. I don't know how to politely get him to shut up, so I'm writing it here in the hopes he'll take the hint ;)</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="feb-week4"> 27-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We slept in really late this morning. In our defense there are no windows in our room so we woke up at 11.30am still in pitch darkness.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We did some housekeeping i.e writing updates, planning where we go next, checking the budget... all the boring adult things we completely neglected to do whilst gallivanting around Koh Tao without a second thought for anything.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex read online that if you visit the ancient city after 4pm then the tickets are half price, which turned out to not be the case however we weren't mad because the park was empty and golden hour was serving. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Erin Bike.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We rented bicycles and rode around freely without checking the map. It was fun to have a sense of urgency and speed around in the limited daylight getting pictures and videos of each other. There was so much to see. All of the temples, statues and monuments are scaled down replicas, and we absolutely did not read any of the information boards explaining the significance of the real buildings.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Golden Temple.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Dome Temple.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We might not have learnt anything but we had a brilliant time. It felt like we had gone out on a date and so we acted unbearably coupley and got gorgeous videos in the process. I hope Alex eventually finds a way for us to upload videos to the website.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Bangkok\Alex Arch.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Dinner was a hard find, so much choice we spent ages deciding but eventually settled on Japanese food at Inari. I had yaki soba which reminded me of the hokkien noodles in phuket. Very delicious. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Morning ferry to catch, very sad to be leaving the island life behind, especially for a 10 hour journey to Bangkok. I made a big mistake eating raw onion at breakfast, it was all I could taste for hours, even after we did get banana roti at a service stop.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were finally spat out straight onto Khaosan Road at 9pm, which was very overwhelming coming from a dark, quiet bus. The street was bustling with party goers, shops, food vendors, clubs, an entire crocodile on a spit. We opted for a safe Pad Thai then had an absolute mission ahead of ourselves in trying to find the hostel. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got a public bus but weren't able to successfully communicate where we needed to get off because we were getting a change, then the bus became jam packed and we were both forced to suspend ourselves over the end of our seats because our backpacks took up too much space. We were eventually told to get off as the ticket lady enthusiastically mimed we were here, as did the driver, telling us to just walk across the bridge. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were in fact not there, nor anywhere. We struggled to catch a taxi but at 11:40pm we did eventually find someone to take us and made It to our hostel/ cat cafe at 12. Thank god for late check ins.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our room is a bunk BUT there is a bean bag couch!</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="44">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 25-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Didn't get much sleep, there was a bunch of English loud mouths at the other end of the hostel that came back late. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were waiting at DJL at 6am feeling very bleary eyed. The shop wasn't even open so we couldn't fill up our water bottle with the ice cold water they have. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were on a commercial ferry instead of their own boat because it was busy, the unfamiliarity made me uneasy, and then we saw an actual Tornado!...maybe more like a baby twister, but either way it was all looking like a bad omen.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Tornado.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">There were other diving schools and professionals on the boat, everybody was swanning about in their aesthetic wetsuits and nice kit, meanwhile me and Alex were struggling to pull on the soaking wet and cold wet suits from the day before. I felt really bitter.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">1st dive was to Chumphon for our deep dive. We went down to 30.9 meters and our instructor pulled out a colour chart so we could see how red and orange become murky and brown, he also had on him a first aid mask so we could see how compressed the air inside became.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We saw a huge moody looking grouper! We slowly swam all the way around him and he didn't move once, just watched up in disdain. Here's a doodle I drew for reference.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Grouper.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We also saw the biggest school of fish yet, we think they were either snapper or smooth tailed trevally. There were thousands, and they were all contained in an invisible barrier that we were at the edge of, so when we looked up it was like looking up at an infinite wall of fish. It was like something out of a Sci Fi. I wish I could explain it better or be able to video it. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">There were swarms of tiny black fish hovering down the coral cliff face, they reminded me so much of flies it freaked me out, but then I saw a bigger blue fish eat one! Very cool.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The last marvel I'm going to labour over explaining was our ascent. For context Chumphon is a really popular site and along with our boat full of 20+ divers there were 3 other boats, so it was busy. At our 6 meter safety stop we became surrounded by rising pillars of air bubbles being exhaled by divers below. We were shallow enough to feel the warmth from the sun, and the light shone down in rays and bounced off the air bubbles. This was more fantasy than Sci fi. It felt magical and glitzy like we were entering a mythical underwater nightclub. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our second dive of the morning was to Green rock, not green but more than enough rock to make up for it. There were triggerfish everywhere and we even saw the teeth on one. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We came back to a ghost town. The hostel is derelict, but the really nice shampoo that was left in the shower is still here! *wink wink* </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went out for our final dive at night. It was exciting to be given torches and descend into darkness but the novelty wore off quickly as it just felt very clumsy. Everyone was knocking into each other because we were made to stay closer. The sound of a boat was terrifying, we couldn't see it looking up but the sound reverberated everywhere and was completely consuming, Alex said he could feel it through his bones. We only saw a glimmer of bioluminescence which was disappointing but even with our torches turned off it wasn't pitch black just because of all the other divers.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got back, showered and warmed up and then made a bee line for Tiki's so we could have the best spring rolls in the world, for the last time. Somebody needs to get the Michelin man out there, it honestly is the nicest food on the island. We got spring rolls, obviously. I ordered a massaman curry and Alex got the fried vegetables with pork, and a fried egg over rice. Practically licked our plates clean then ordered mango sticky rice for dessert. Ended our time here on a real high, and Tiki even ran to give me a hug! </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 24-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Checked back into the DJL hostel, gave our scooter back and got the full deposit back even though Alex had dropped it! Budget looks happy, Alex is happy. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went out for our afternoon dives with Matt and Diana. Little bit disappointed that we were never given the option to pick our dives so we ended up going to White Rock and Twins again to learn peak buoyancy and navigation.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Diana turned up a full hour late and proved herself to be an even bigger liability when she and the instructor got lost practicing navigation and left me, Alex and Matt 17 meters deep by a submerged frame waiting.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Out of nowhere, I was so relaxed I didn't even realise, I started to float up, the air in my BCD obviously expanded as I ascended and for some reason I was really struggling to purge it. Mid panic and at least 5 meters up Alex turned around and realised. He shot up and grabbed my foot, and with his dive computer screaming at him for ascending too quickly emptied his lungs to drag us both back down slowly. Matt watched cluelessly and with limited communication asked 'okay?' 'Okay'. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We did more waiting, made friends with a curious fish that stayed close with us, gave each other puzzled looks and after periodically squinting into the blue expanse we realised mine and Matt’s air was getting low. Like well trained good little divers we did our safety stop for 3 minutes at 6 meters and just as we emerged there was our instructor frantically looking around for us, with Diana waving madly from the boat. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It had been a complete disaster, Diana and the instructor had swam around searching for us ages before they came up, and allegedly the boat had moved so the instructor was disorientated. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Back on the boat Alex and Matt were gushing over their expert safety stop. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our second dive felt aimless and I think I learnt more from Diana on how to do a forwards roll than I did from the instructor. We had fun though, Alex kicked me in the face and when I tried to mime it to him he was misunderstanding which made me giggle. This really concerned him which only made me laugh more, then my mask was getting flooded, he was panicking. I was laughing uncontrollably which he still didn't understand, it's only when I inhaled a nose full of water that I managed to stop. I can still laugh now about it, all I could see was his eyes like saucers watching thinking something was seriously wrong with me.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We surfaced from our second dive after we all successfully navigated a 30 x 30 m square. It was golden hour and we could feel the heat on our heads as we were ascending, then when we came up the sea was completely still and everything was basked in warm sunlight, it was so dreamy. Me and Alex sat on the top of the boat with our legs dangling down as we sailed away. I felt really blessed, but maybe that's just because Alex had brought me up an extra sweet cup of tea. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Calm After Dive.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We had a last meal with our little group as Dianna and Yelle were leaving that evening and Bart was going in the morning. It was a bit sad but the immense amount of food made up for it. We took Bart and Matt to the Hacienda for the pub desserts. Still think the sticky toffee pudding was best but Alex's carrot cake with cream cheese frosting comes a very close second...once again I didn't have time to get a picture.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">It took a lot to overcome our food coma from the previous night so we had a really lazy day. Met Yelle and Bart for lunch then went to DJL to book our advanced diving. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After peer pressure from the 'adults' me and Alex reluctantly went to finally get a Thai massage at sunset. We were recommended the full hour but I wimped out and opted for only 30 minutes. It was a lot of prodding about and the way she went in on my shoulder genuinely induced fear. I felt a bit lopsided afterwards because not everything done to one side of my back was mirrored. I didn't enjoy it much but Alex did, he had his fingers cracked! I would have immediately left had that happened to me.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Another day snorkeling, I don't think it could ever get boring here. Bart brought a friend he made from his morning Scuba diving, Yelle. Another very friendly Dutch man for Alex to show off free diving in front off. I'm being mean, we were all suitably impressed as Alex really does, without sarcasm, look like a son of Poseidon.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Son of Posioden.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We've got a little group now established with me, Alex, Bart, Yelle and Diana. We met up for a big meal of Korean hot pot and bbq. It was really great, we cooked food together and shared our favourite combinations. Diana started frying big chunks of pineapple at the end which was incredible! And we were surprised by chocolate and matcha Ice cream. As a group I think we really ate our money’s worth.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We spent the day hanging out with Bart again, and went for lunch at another beautiful look out point.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Cafe View Everyone.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Bart has decided to help Alex be less of a control freak and pressured him into letting me keep all our money. Alex had a look of anguish when he saw how I was, or rather wasn't organising the notes, and I had to really cram them into my purse. I was then made responsible for paying, which I did whilst Bart and Alex watched over like proud parents. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We returned to Shark Bay in another search for Whale Sharks and once again only found turtles. However, we did get to see two turtles coming together, and both me and Alex managed to separately find a quiet moment to swim alongside one. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">By chance Bart managed to capture us with his go pro.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Turtle.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Me and Alex then went for a highly anticipated Sunday Dinner at Hacienda. We decided to walk and in doing so witnessed a bike crash, or rather someone getting a 'koh tao tattoo' since they're so common here. The sound of screeching plastic was awful, tomorrow we go back to diligently wearing helmets. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I managed in the brief moment before we absolutely inhaled our food to get a picture, but I had no such luck when it came to dessert. We ordered a sticky toffee pudding and apple crumble, words cannot describe how utterly delectable they both were. We wobbled home with warm full bellies, having eaten every crumb from our meal.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="feb-week3"> 20-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Updates! Where were we....</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Today I hung out with our new dutch friend Bart whilst Alex was busy with his 2nd day free diving. We went to a tree house cafe, the view was fantastic and I finally had a coconut. Also I tried massaman curry for the first time, wish I'd discovered it sooner! New favourite meal. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Cafe View Bart.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Similar to yesterday, the day started with time in the classroom improving our breathing technique and learning some yoga/meditation to do in our free time. Because one of the lads in our group dropped out, I was moved to another instructor. This meant the fierce competition was stifled as me and the lad from London were now separated. Dives 1, 2 and 3 were set at 10, 15 and 20 metres respectively and just like that, I reached the bottom on all 3. With the pressure off I thought it would all be fun and games from there but I failed to equalise on a couple of goes which stopped me reaching any significant depth. After being told to shorten my breathe up, the equalisation issues let up and I made it to 20 metres a second time. I’d heard my instructor mention sitting at the bottom as we were close to a shipwreck and there were many fish around (I had spent time admiring them on my ascent). Armed with this knowledge I thought I’d sit at the bottom for some time and have a good look around. I got myself to 20 metres and as I went to take a look around, I tried to breathe in through my nose and got panicked so immediately began my ascent. Quickly I calmed myself but by the time I reached the surface I was grateful for the air.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Once Alex was finished we all met back up and went snorkeling on the East Coast. There was no beach so we had to jump straight in off the rocks but it surpassed all expectations. As a novice snorkeler I can't comment too much, but Alex agrees it's the best snorkeling he's ever done too. The coral was vibrant and healthy and the huge rocks extended below the water so we could dive down (some better than others *Alex*) and explore different depths and crevices. We also had fun playing with Bart’s go pro. We were in the water nearly 3 hours without even realising. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Bart loves coconuts almost as much as me and Alex love spring rolls so after swimming he took Alex as an apprentice and they went off to hunt down a coconut. I acted very impressed by their show of masculinity, prodding the tree with a big stick and then repeatedly throwing the coconut onto a rock to break through the husk. I have been awarded the title of Princess and accepted the coconut graciously. My role as Princess has become a very convenient excuse for not doing things. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Coconut Tree.jpg" alt="meh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Alex Coconut.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">In the evening a group of us from the hostel watched the fire show on the beach together, Diana got flustered over one of the 'fire boys' and afterwards got his Instagram! Apparently the only accounts he follows were for cat lovers, so I don't think she'll bother pursuing. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Fireshow.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We all got food together and Bart was served his meal with an unexpected fried egg on top which we have come to assume is an apology egg because the lady told him he couldn't use the toilet when we first arrived and got really mad, thinking he wasn't staying for food. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Me, Alex and Bart then stayed out and played pool where Bart effortlessly socialised and strung us along with him so we ended up speaking to a lot of people. We also played beer pong and a beautiful dutch girl called Alex the 'ping pong king'. We only found out at the end of the night that the boy she was traveling with was in fact her brother, not boyfriend. Should I have been worried? ;)</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It was a really great day that we finished off with banana roti just before bed.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="38">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 19-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">I predictably did not get up to much on my own, I wimped out of riding the bike (the roads are far more chaotic here than on Yao Yai) so I just walked to a beach and sunnied myself, ate some tomato crisps, dipped in the sea and read my book. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">On a more exciting note here's what Alex got up to (in his own words).</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I woke up bright and early, leaving Erin in bed with her pocket money and keys to the bike she didn't use. My freediving adventure started with nearly 3 hours in a classroom learning breathing techniques, how to be super efficient descending and more. We got kitted up with some jumbo fins and after feeling a little nervous, I quickly got comfortable in the water. There were 2 different techniques: one was pulling ourselves down the rope the other holding our nose as we kicked. The fins made a huge difference and my first attempt with the kicking technique (which I thought was rubbish) came out at an easy 12 metres. Another lad there from London was confident and we both reached the maximum depth for today's dive of 14 metres on our 5th or 6th attempt. We'll see who wins tomorrow when the maximum is extended to 20 metres. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Back at the hostel we met Bart from the Netherlands, took him to Tiki's to try the immense spring rolls and Alex taught him how to play windows, I lost to them both. Learned about the all-in-one kitchen appliance that he develops as a job, then we played Rummikub. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">oh! I almost forgot, we went out for ice cream and saw this super adorable 'angel messages' so I picked one out, and replaced it with my own note.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Ice Cream.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">It is now however, only half 7, the hostel is dark and windowless and we have nothing to do because Alex has been told that he shouldn't drink if he's going to get down to 20 meters tomorrow.</p>
						</div>

							</figure>
							<p class="diary-entries">We're now in the hostel because we got 3 nights free with our diving that we didn't use at the time. Alex booked a freediving course for tomorrow, I was absolutely not going to join him in that, I cannot imagine anything worse but the diving school boasts an impressive set of professionals to learn from and reckons they can get even beginners down to 20 meters. Sounds terrifying. He'll be doing that for the next 2 days, I'll just be mooching around I suppose, pretending to be a strong independent woman and not the princess that I've been acting like. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Shark Bay.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to Shark Bay and naturally tried to spot ourselves a shark. Swam out 250 meters, saw a lot of dead looking coral and a few fish, 1 or 2 angel fish for me to stalk, they're so calming, but no sharks. Ready to head back when Alex grabbed my legs, absolutely huge turtle in the water behind us! He was just minding his own business, had fish attached onto his shell and a crowd of snorkelers sticking cameras in his face. After the initial shock and feeling of awe, I was getting sad watching everyone not give him space but just before I left him he floated up to the surface and among all the bobbing heads looking down I saw his small Dino head emerge like an old wise man among rounded idiots. I loved it.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Back at our hostel we met another couple traveling and joined them for drinks and food. They had just done their first day of the open diving course but the girl wasn't carrying on.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Day 3 complete! Certified open water divers right here! </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Sunny Diving.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">It's wild, the enjoyment I feel is so delayed. Now that I'm sat down with a hearty well deserved meal, I feel euphoric and very pleased with myself but I struggle to recognise that when we're actually diving. Before the dives I'm nervous, during the dives I'm suppressing terror and when I'm not too cold to move my arms, I'm fluttering my hands across my regulator and mask to check they won't spontaneously combust and disappear from my face. In-between dives I'm absolutely freezing and experiencing sea sickness for the first time ever but afterwards, I'm elated. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It's such an unfamiliar feeling for me to not understand myself this much, all that being said I think I'll do my advanced course, maybe I'm just a masochist ;) </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Today's dives were really cool, I saw a fish that looked just like a lemon! It's called a box fish but I couldn't stop thinking about how I always said growing up that I'd get a smiley face lemon tattoo and there it was! Just bobbing about in front of me in real life. It was so cute I couldn't believe it. We also saw something like a Stingray but it was pink! Really gave us the side eye. So many schools of fish just engulfed us and even the coral looked like it was alive and breathing. We did successfully reach 18 meters deep even if we did have to cut the last dive short because I was cold. I wish I had a fish encyclopedia with me because I can't commit that many different species to memory.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Armed with new recommendations from Kes, we went out and had the best spring rolls ever! They were as thick as my wrist and full of glass noodles, carrot and cabbage, no picture this time but we'll be back! Finally tried mango sticky rice too! Has to be one of the best days.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Day 2 of getting our open water diving certificate, Day 1 of actually experiencing open water and the weather was horrendous. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">It rained all through the night and all through the day. The sky was gray, the sea was gray, and from how cold I was, I was also gray. Kes was the only one excited to get on the boat and dive. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I did get a full length wetsuit and a long sleeve baselayer in an attempt to keep me warm but unsurprisingly I was dithering still. Within minutes on the boat we were fully wet through, along with any clothes or towels we'd taken out with us. It felt harrowing, Alex would probably tell the story less dramatically. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Cloudy Diving.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The dive was incredible and with only a handful of skills left to demonstrate we could enjoy the dive site plenty. The coral is amazing and it feels so much more immersive than snorkeling. Deepest we went was 12 meters and because of the weather and reduced sunlight we were able to experience blue water diving, where you can't see anything besides a blue expanse in all directions. I generally try my best to not look up or down regardless as I have a lot of fear to suppress. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got back and hung our clothes up at the shop to dry. Had a few drinks with Kes and the other guy learning with us, Julian. Then we were invited out by another instructor and eventually ended up at a place called Baby Rasta. It was like being inside a kids secret den, there were different levels and ways around but it’s built like a tree house so you can see through all the sections. There were hammocks and cushions and occasional stools dotted around, it was all very haphazard and relaxed. Maybe we'll go back at some point. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I've made no more progress on the online learning that needed to be done. I'm writing this all in retrospect because I got in woozy and managed one bite of a chicken wrap before passing out asleep. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex was far more sober and stayed up eating, learning and overachieving. Kes peppered him with compliments over his natural affinity with water when we were out, I'd be jealous but there's absolutely no competition that Alex is better than me and finding the course easy. Hilariously the only problem Alex has is communication, who'd have guessed? We go over the brief, we go down into the water, Kes signals to do what we discussed and Alex is clueless. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 15-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Day 1 of getting our open water diving certificate, completed. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent the entire day in a swimming pool working on skills. The pool was a gorgeous infinity pool looking out infinitely onto the weed farm below, there was also a very mild current in the pool which I couldn't keep myself standing still in. Our instructor, Kes, kept having to move me away from the vent else I'd 'blow away like an Autumn leaf'.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Kes has even curlier hair than Alex and calls me darling. Alex has graciously allowed me to develop a small crush. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Overall the skills weren't too difficult: we learned to manually inflate our BCD, share air, do a controlled emergency ascent and how to enter the water from a boat. Obviously Alex took to it effortlessly. I struggled with having to remove my mask and put it back on underwater, really having to fight with myself to not spontaneously try to breathe through my nose and inhale water. I only really panicked once. I also struggle to keep myself neutrally buoyant, I'm either floating or sinking. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Think I must be the only person to feel cold in a tropical swimming pool, whilst Alex's scalp was being fried by the sun. I have no idea how to stop it, but Kes said he'll search around and find something warmer for me to wear for tomorrow's dive.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After 6hrs and nearly stumbling at the last hurdle to simply swim 200m, we were finished and sitting down for a well deserved meal of noodles and dumplings. The Dumplings were incredible, soft on top, crispy bottoms and filled with pork. It was great, then we just got back and slept for 14 hours.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Made the executive decision to postpone Valentine's day. I won't be forgetting about it, cash in that token the next time I see something I want to buy ;)</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Spent the majority of the day visiting Koh Nang Yuan. Only a short journey away and besides the iconic view point with the 3 small islands connected by a white sand Bank, it’s also a great place to snorkel.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Got a taste of home as we cued in line to get the picture on a rock, felt like a line at Alton Towers. Alex didn't even want a picture in the end! But enjoy this one of me since we waited long enough. Tried to hide the fact I was dripping with sweat by wearing the hat.</p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Tao\Erin Nang Yuan.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Went snorkeling for hours, stalked a rainbow fish and desperately tried to memorise the colours to describe later, then remembered we bought an underwater camera specially! Spent hours swimming around trying to capture every type of fish, Animal crossing style, I swam every inch of the bay, even carefully going across the coral, only to discover all the footage is jumbled up because of the reflections from the water and we needed to buy a specific case for the camera to stop that happening. Now I’m stuck trying to remember if my rainbow fish was more blue with pink, or pink with more yellow? Hoping when I have the time to go over all the videos we can find some small highlights to share because the fish were amazing! Whole cast of nemo was down there.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Very tired but I’ve predictably left the training material for tomorrow until the last minute so I've got to push through and get that done. Obviously Alex is already a module ahead. There's 5 sections to complete in total.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="32">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="feb-week2"> 13-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent the morning trudging around trying to find a scooter to hire. Alex was understandably very uneasy about going somewhere that wanted to hold your passport as a form of deposit, which narrowed down our options considerably. I guess the locals have had bad experiences with tourists trying to return bikes that have been beaten up. We didn't manage to get a scooter until the evening so we weren't able to explore far. There is however no rush because we'll have plenty of time to see everything now that we're staying longer to complete a PADI diving certificate! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to Davy Jones Locker Diving School today and booked to start on Wednesday! We have all the e-learning to complete before then, initially very excited but having watched the first video tonight that consisted of 45 min info dumping I'm feeling overwhelmed. Very naive of me to not once consider the risks involved and now that I've seen a burst balloon being used as a metaphor for my lungs I am having second thoughts. I also stubbornly rebel against e-learning and the monotonous <i>try as many times as you need to get 100%</i> but Alex has made his position very clear in that we will be completing the quizzes independently after watching each video and taking notes. I've had fun 'acting up' and seriously stressing him out. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Spent some time at the beach in awe of how bright and clear everything looked. Prescription sunglasses are the best investment I have ever made, where have they been all my life?... Probably hiding behind the £200 price tag. I think we're going to love our time here! </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Another largely uneventful day traveling. Set off at half 8 from our airbnb and didn't make it to the next one until 3.30pm. The ferry was excruciatingly long and at 10mph I think I could have swam it faster with a pool noodle. Alex is poleaxed and sleep talking next to me right now. Apparently we 'need room to go kart'. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">There's a small town just down the road that we walked to, ate a day's worth of food in one meal and made it to the beach for the sunset. We took a little dip in the water as the sky turned the world into a parma violet haze and the water was clear and beautiful with the sun still reflecting pink on the surface. It felt very dream-like. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Tomorrow we will rent a scooter and be able to explore properly. I cannot wait to finally go snorkeling. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Only did a little bit of mooching around. We went to the same place for food as the first day here, where you write down your own order. I thought it was a little strange but today we heard the lady explaining it’s because when they first opened and were just serving food from their house they didn't have any staff to take the orders. It’s still only managed by a mum and daughter and it’s their way of remembering where their business started. Had the nicest noodle soup, tasted really clean and healthy. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I bought myself some super adorable Snoopy shorts that look like they were made from a kids duvet cover. They're ugly cute. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Samui\Snoopy Shorts.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">We learnt that the two most precious gifts from nature come provided from a convenient street side dispenser. That being water, and petrol. It's crazy how similar the two machines look and operate, just pop in your pennies and press the green button! It does make you feel like they're on the same level which is concerning. </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Samui\Petrol Vending.jpg" alt="meh">
							<p class="diary-entries">Spent a lazy hazy afternoon playing in the pool. Tested how long Alex could stay underwater with me giving him breaths of air. I was clumsy and not very quick,  he started panicking after 2 consecutive underwater kisses.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I also got Alex to try on my bikini but that's pay for view only. Very sexy and definitely not an ick.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We also had a pretend 3 legged race, without any rope to actually tie our legs together and without any competitors. Still, think we would dominate the sport, our timing was immaculate even at a light jog.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="29">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 10-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We slept in late and both got an excessive 12 hrs sleep. The bed here is the comfiest one yet. Spent a while looking for food, very underwhelmed by the options. We expected to find authentic little places tucked away like in Krabi and Phuket but Lamai seems to be far more geared towards tourism, which means higher prices for mediocre Western food. I think tomorrow we will have to search further afield. </P>
							<p class="diary-entries">Obviously we still have to eat, and waking up so late means the clock is ticking for Alex. We settled for somewhere and Alex showed himself to be a man of no principle. He has consistently told me, for weeks now, that banana splits are a joke. His hatred for them was surprisingly strong, but he really convinced me they were boring and just a way to get children to eat a banana. Well, you know where this is going. Here's the picture for proof. </P>

							<p class="diary-entries">We went to the beach, it had people and rubbish strewn across it and looked more than a little dreary but the waves coming in looked exciting. We waded out, I let myself get gently lifted by the waves whilst Alex threw himself around like a mad man. Then he decided I wasn't doing enough and had the bright idea to lie me flat and give me a push on a big wave, supposedly he planned for me to ride on top of the wave. I was on top of nothing and swallowed a gallon of water through my mouth and nose. Then I was just getting battered by all the breaking waves.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">We decided we'd have a good go at drinking in the evening but when we went out it was every bar fighting to have their music heard, playing dance music with nobody dancing. The people sitting around drinking all looked bored and after getting fried rice from the night market we went straight back home. We made a poor attempt to drink sake but with the bed so close we fell asleep earlier than planned. </P>
							<p class="diary-entries">I did take another apocalyptic image whilst we were briefly out. Very spooky looking moon over the beach.</P>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="koh-samui"> 09-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Wish I had more to say on our first impressions of Koh Samui but the coach and ferry ended up taking 6 hrs 30 and left us both feeling knackered. We couldn’t sleep on the coach because the driver was acting like he was on a scooter and treated the accelerator like an on/ off button so we were never at a smooth constant speed but were jerked around for the entire drive.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">From the ferry we caught a bus and had our backpacks thrown onto the roof, then the heavens opened with a vengeance and our bags got soaked. Nothing inside my bag got wet, but Alex was not so lucky. Worst of all, the soap for our clothes, that we had started to use very conservatively to make last, has leaked all over his toiletry bag. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We’ve landed ourselves in yet another lovely airbnb with a wonderfully friendly host. I smacked my shin on the metal footboard of our bed, I even made a big deal over warning Alex about it because it’s hidden under the bedsheets. Not even 30 minutes later I throw myself down onto the bed in a dramatic display of exhaustion and nearly knock myself out. I hit my temple not even a cm away from my eye on the same damn bedframe I specifically made a point over! I’m not too sure where the tears came from but I cried<i> a lot</i>. Alex after his initial slew of abuse calling me an idiot and telling me off for ‘floundering around’ did comfort me but it was too late and I could only ride out the self pity in full. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got food, I took this picture of the street and sky which I thought looked moody and foreboding. I hope tomorrow is better weather, and that I don't wake up with a black eye.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Happi in Krabi! It’s just for one night whilst we wait to get our bus in the morning up to Koh Samui but a great opportunity for us to revisit our favorite restaurant here and stock up on more banana bread from the night market! We also tried the softest fluffiest sponge cake ever, shame we only got one to share, it was 90% air and barely left an aftertaste. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We’ve done a bit of research on where to go after Koh Samui, decided to skip out Koh PhaNgan to spend more time in Koh Tao, hopefully find some clear water and fishes to spy on. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We cheaped out on the room for tonight and as a consequence our AC unit is broken. I think at this point it's actually blowing out warmer air than outside. Feels like it’s going to be a really long night. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Another day doing sweet nothing, we’ve lazed around at the beach having conversations in the sand and playing frisbee. </p>

							</figure>
							<p class="diary-entries">There appears to be a disproportionate amount of children living on the island compared to adults. The school looks big but it's not just that, there’s children ferrying each other around on scooters and nearly every scooter that does have an adult on, has a child crammed in somewhere! My conspiracy is that the island really belongs to children and they just employ a few adults to stand at food venders as a front. However, if the crabs decided to stage a coup they’d have the numbers. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Would have liked to do some night swimming at the beach like on Noi but the thought of millions of crabs all coming out of their tiny holes in the sand is enough to stop me. We finally saw a full sized crab today, they camouflage so well but I think Alex has temporarily traded in plane spotting for crab spotting, he likes chasing them until they throw themselves into the sea. The assurance that ‘they’re more scared of you’ is not enough to make me join in with any amount of commitment. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent hours riding across the entire island in the search for pancakes, the two places we found from google were closed. It was a fruitless effort and we once again settled for rice and noodles. Alex was appalled by the portion size more than usual. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Oh! Big news, I have gained enough confidence, and Alex has gained enough trust in me, that I have become a respected and skilled second driver on the scooter! As long as I wear my glasses we can take turns to ride first. It’s great fun but Alex still pulls a face having to sit at the back because it's less comfortable and I maybe can’t always see bumps in the road that I need to slow down for until we’ve hit them. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Gone out specifically to poach WiFi so we can update the website and download more from Netflix, but otherwise I think we would have stayed sitting on our porch playing windows for hours and completely forgotten to eat again. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Now with a full belly and only a slightly distracting reggae cover of 'country roads' playing from a radio, I’m free to write. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Yai\Cafe View.jpeg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Life feels good today, in the course of 24hrs me and Alex have enacted a typical story plot with rising tensions amounting in a major climax of emotional fallout at around 3am (it was very dramatic) but now we've made it to the turning point in our story where we come to many resolutions and can sit happily sipping coke and enjoying the sun together.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We've had a great morning, high tide was later today at 11am so we were at the beach with the white sand with plenty of time to enjoy it. We played more with the Frisbee and I tried out my new and improved breaststroke technique which I do believe I've made progress in. Alex has finally started to share his puzzle book with me so I was able to sit quizzically for a while with him and now my head feels as clear as the sky. We will frazzle in this sun for sure.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Yai\White Beach.jpg">

							<p class="diary-entries">Breakfast was slightly disappointing, we both specifically ordered 'pancakes with banana inside and on top' and what arrived were pancakes with only banana on top. It’s just not on, but no time to sulk because we had a long tail boat with our names on it... or rather the name of our next island Koh Yao Yai! A very quick 10 minute island hop.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our host made a real effort and met us at the pier with a scooter ready and taxi ordered to help us with our bags and our home for the next 3 nights is perfect! It's a farmstead but I've only seen a few chickens mulling about nearby. There's only two properties, ours and the neighbouring one with a Russian guy staying, it’s private and cosy. Alex said the walkways make it feel like the Maldives but without the water, which makes it sound a bit naff but ignore him, it's really nice.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We've rode down the entirety of the main road already, it doesn't feel like there's much more to explore which is baffling considering how much larger this island is compared to Noi but it feels so empty! I have no idea where the 1,000s of supposed residents live. The full extent of the town appears to be a 7/11 and 5 food vendors, it does feel like a quiet retreat. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to a beach covered in glorious fine white sand. The tide was out so we couldn't experience the beauty in full but plenty of time to return. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Yai\Erin Beach.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">I've realised that I have started to drink Thai tea as a replacement to my regular cups of tea at home, but I'll have to put a stop to it soon before I turn the same bright orange colour, it cannot be good for me and there's enough sugar in it to hold my straw up, almost. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We met a particularly earnest burger man that asked us after our meal if he could have done anything better, even though he gets a 5 star google review for just having mayonnaise and ketchup! </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">A replacement for Scoopy came this morning, this scooter is blue and just isn't giving the same energy.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had an easy day enjoying the sun, I tried in vain to even out some of my tan lines by the pool and then we went to the beach and played Frisbee thanks to Andrea (and Alex's determination to pack it). Then Alex went on a spontaneous jog around the beach and returned with a dramatic story about 1000's of crabs.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to pick up our bug spray that we had left in Scoopy from the women and when we arrived she smiled and pointed at Scoopy by the side of the road in a way to suggest 'good news the tire’s fixed' but Alex just looked over and said 'oh, there he is' which made me feel really sad. I think we need to socialise with other people more because we have both gotten tragically attached to the only other thing besides each other that has been around more than 3 days.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">On the subject of socialising, Alex made friends with a screaming child in the restaurant that we went to in the evening. He got her told off for being too loud and excited, which is no different to back home with Theo. He's such a bad influence. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Koh Yao Noi has been the first place that we've stayed at for 4 nights and haven't wanted to leave sooner. Really excited to see how Koh Yao Yai compares.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">'We'll explore the North of the island tomorrow' a fateful decision that might have become a key piece of evidence in a missing person investigation. Exploring the North became a disastrous adventure that eventually led us to a birthday party.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We rode on Scoopy (in hindsight we shouldn't have given the bike a pet name) down a winding road that snakes through the centre of the island. Unbeknownst to us using Google for directions, the road does not maintain itself as a usable road for very long and becomes a dirt path, then a rocky trail. Scoopy served us well but he struggled on the constant uphills. Eventually we had to accept that the trail is now completely inaccessible by bike, but Google promised we were close to the North most bay that we had been heading towards. We walked for 20 minutes through the jungle with a cliff edge to the right. In my happy oblivion I tend to not pay any attention to time or circumstance but Alex began to panic about it going dark and felt threatened by the sound of monkeys. We pushed on and found Mankei Bay which looked particularly beautiful under the bright moon, but then we had a raging argument which lasted the entire walk back to Scoopy, in admittedly the pitch black. Then we had to ride Scoopy down the rocky trail which was difficult in daylight and near impossible in the dark but you can trust Alex to not take any risks and ride slow. Very slow. Not that it made any difference because half way through the back tire went flat and we were stranded. No street lights, no houses, and no phone signal. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Noi\Mankei Moon.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We pushed Scoopy and Alex showed a glimmer of hope as he remembered the woman we hired the scooters from gave us her card to WhatsApp her if we were in any trouble. Funny thing is I knew that I had already squirreled the card away into my 'memory pouch' along with all the other cards, tickets and receipts I've collected, kept safe in my backpack, back at the airbnb. Alex didn't find it particularly funny. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Close to the beginning of the 'road' part a few people went past on scooters without stopping to help and in our crippling shyness we weren't about to call out but then, from the distance we heard 'Sawadee Ka' A little old women, our saviour, emerged from a house and through elaborate explanations with our hands we told her about the flat tire. She went next door to get her daughter, who called our airbnb for us. Our host then sent her grandson to pick us up, who arrived only 10 minutes later riding a beaten up scooter with a metal cage attached for us to sit in. Off we rode almost smoothly into the distance. Our driver had to shimmy a leg out and help push us up the hills, but we made it back to our place.</p>

							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Noi\Sunrise.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">After a regrettable nap which had us both waking up drenched in sweat inside our cabin that had become a hot box, we decided to take a dip in the swimming pool. Alex painstakingly tried to teach me a proper breaststroke, but he gave up and went back to his puzzle book and I have made no progress. Alex thinks secretly progress was made but I just don't know about it.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After 3 weeks and gradual complacency with suncream we are both sunburnt. Alex is more burnt than me and has already made me moisturise his back twice. We will be more careful going forward.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent a few hours riding around the island on the scooter, we'll explore the North of the island tomorrow. Alex let me drive the scooter to the beach in the morning but he has absolutely no trust in me and wouldn't stop panicking so now I have resigned to sitting on the back again. I don't mind too much though because I get to look around more.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Today brought around a real highlight to the trip. </P>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got a bus to the pier and then a speedboat to Koh Yao Noi. Trekked for far too long with our bags to a scooter rental place, the lovely woman gave us a discount for hiring a scooter for 5 days and helped us ride our bags to the airbnb because despite our best efforts we couldn't balance 2 people and 6 bags onto the scooter.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">We checked in to a cute cabin and said hello to both our neighbours (there's no WiFi in the room so updates will be slow again) then we ran the scooter just 5 minutes down the road to the closest beach, got there just in time to watch the sunset with not a single other person in sight. </P>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Noi\First Night Sunset.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We waded out into the water which even at high tide is barely waist deep, but it was incredibly calm. There we were just floating on our backs comfortably when I noticed a faint blue glow in the splash from moving my arm. I thought I'd imagined it! Bioluminescent plankton!! It was so unexpected, once we noticed it seemed to be everywhere. It was so incredibly magical, it rose up and scattered with every movement, rolling over our skin like dancing fairies of electric blue light. We took turns drawing attention to each other like children 'look at me!' Then performing elaborate waves and dances to draw up the most light and then giggling in wonder. I have no idea how long we spent out there in the dark, I think it's one of my favourite memories ever.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">Finished the night sat at the restaurant attached to the airbnb which the owner kindly kept open for us, and once he had closed up the kitchen he brought us a light so we could stay here whilst Alex catches up uploading the entries from the past few days. </P>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Noi\Lamplight.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">I think we're both going to love it here.</P>

							<p class="diary-entries">Another similar day. No plans. Alex loves his puzzle book a little too much and has been consumed.</P>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Puzzle Book.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We went out specifically for dessert and tried Patongo, which didn't look too appetizing but tasted very much like a donut. Very funny that it came with scissors, dedicated to their banishment of knives. Alex especially enjoyed the drizzle on top, the pervert. </P>

							</figure>
							<p class="diary-entries">We'd planned to stay out a little longer but Alex had an 'embarrassing' encounter and being absolutely mortified made us go back to the airbnb. It wasn't such a big deal, but Alex brushed off a guy in the street who had said 'can I ask you a question?' The guy chuckled after Alex said no and we walked past, then we heard him ask someone else and realized he just wanted someone to take a picture for him. Alex felt awful. It was funny at first but following a night of self pity I couldn't laugh.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">Coming to accept there is no internet in this black hole. Music plays loudly from the hotel next door, but that's better than the previous night where fireworks were set off every 20 minutes.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">A late addition to the entry! There is a cockroach in the room! Saw it pacing across the room when we were playing cards. I was surprised that Alex was scared of it, he had his torch out to check where it had disappeared off to and was very preoccupied. He said 'of course I'm scared it's creepy'. It is rather big and admittedly creepy. The situation escalated when we tried to gently coax it onto the balcony and the result was Alex stood on a stool in the bathroom. Sadly I didn't get a picture.</P>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="jan-week4"> 30-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Spent today much like yesterday, I don't know why going out to explore Phuket doesn't really appeal.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">We did go out for food which again was really good, when we walked past a second time there was a queue waiting outside so must be highly rated. Then we walked to a huge stationary store, which is not quite the cultural experience we should be seeking out but it was a lot of fun. We also saw the Thailand equivalent to a lolly pop man! Much cooler, he helped us cross with a bunch of school kids.</P>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Lollipop Man.jpg" alt="Lollipop Man">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Erin with Drink.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex realised he accidentally left us without a night anywhere when he booked our next airbnb stay for the 1st of Feb and extended our stay here by only one night, there are 31 days in January. Being so last minute we've had to book another night here! 4 nights in a place we were only supposed to stay 2. Bored tirelessly and just want to move on but Alex cheered me up some by taking us to the Thailand McDonald's!</P>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Alex Burger.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We tried the Samurai Burger and cheese sticks which were exactly what we needed and the fries were super hot and crunchy. I made the mistake of getting the Pineapple pie to try which was disgusting, but proof that Alex will really eat anything, he gobbled that up too. He is however complaining of a sore jaw now as he has forgotten what chewing food feels like after so much rice and bite sized pieces of meat.</P>

							<p class="diary-entries">There is nothing to say about today. Alex spends an increasing amount of time with his hands down his pants. I suppose tonight we will continue to watch knives out for the third night as Alex refuses to take the hint that I'm not enjoying the film. </P>
							<p class="diary-entries">Sorry, for reals.</P>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Street Drinks.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We have both shamelessly had a very lazy day. Think I slept more than 14 hours last night and today. We didn’t leave the room until 6pm and I think that was only because hunger was getting harder to ignore. We aimed to visit the Sunday walking street market but for some reason all the streets around Old town were bustling with stalls and people, they even had wardens blocking the roads to cars. It was just too busy, you couldn’t possibly stand to browse the clothes or pick out snacks. We did buy a drink and I took a few quick pictures but we headed out of the busy streets as soon as we could. Eventually we found a little ramen restaurant, the food was delicious, but then after not eating all day anything might have tasted good. The fried prawns I know for sure were exceptional, we ordered them twice. </P>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Busy Street.jpg">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Prawns.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We’ve chosen to stay here another night and then head over to Koh Yao Noi for a few nights to enjoy quiet island life. </P>
						</div>
						
						<div id="16">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="phuket"> 28-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Not too much to say about today. We checked out at 11 and said goodbye to Krabi, which I think has been my favourite place on the trip so far. The bus to Phuket was only 3.5 hours on a relatively comfortable coach, however Alex was sat on a very determined recliner seat that would not stay upright despite his best efforts. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Only left the airbnb to get dinner. Another good meal, I think we’re back on a winning streak in that department. Hoping to sleep off the tiredness in my legs from the Temple yesterday and start tomorrow bright and early ready to explore Phuket old town. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="15">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 27-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Lay in bed feeling really sleepy and content. We’ve had a really good day, finished off with especially delicious food and now i’m exhausted and happy looking forward to a long undisturbed sleep. It really is a charmed life. I will have to save all the details from today to fill in tomorrow morning. Now I must sleep and think happy thoughts.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries" style="border-top: 20vh">We rented a scooter and went to the tiger cave temple. 1,260 very steep and uneven steps to ascend. We got there early just as several schools were getting back on the coaches. One girl called over that I was pretty and another asked for a photo with me. Then I was swarmed by school girls waiting to get pictures. I felt so awkward and self conscious but they were all so friendly I didn’t know how to say no. Think that's the most popular I’ll ever be. Two boys went to Alex and shook his hand, but when he introduced himself they giggled and ran off. It was an unexpected start to the day. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Climbing the steps to the temple felt very intensive, and I will admit that half way up I told Alex I physically could not make it to the top, but then we were passed by two 60 year olds that said ‘shame on the both of you’ and then a mother literally carrying her 3 year old on her back. I piped down then and dragged my sorry ass to the top. </p>
							
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Tiger Steps.jpg">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Tiger Budda.jpg" style="margin-top: 12vh; margin-bottom: 16vh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The view was incredible, the south was completely flat and to the north were huge limestone cliffs and forests. It was worth the climb. A monkey tried to steal Alex’s water bottle again! I'm not worried about Alex giving it up though, he’s taking no prisoners. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Tiger View.jpg" style="margin-top: 21vh; margin-bottom: 26vh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Erin View.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we went on an hour-long ride to visit the emerald pool. I might have enjoyed the journey more than the destination, it was so relaxing sitting on the back holding onto Alex and just watching the scenery go past. The pool was still very fun, couldn’t really get a picture and it was quite busy but freshwater always feels nicer than sea water, and it was in fact very emerald in colour. </p>

							</figure>
							<p class="diary-entries">I think the real highlight of the day for us both was going to the hot spring waterfall. I read afterwards that the water temperature is between 40 to 50 (DEGREES). It was so toasty warm, with several natural pools to swim and bob about in. It was very cool, although I thought Alex was dead at one point, he was floating face down holding his breath for an uncomfortable amount of time.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">On the subject of things nearly being dead, Alex spooked a dog going past on the scooter and nearly ran it over. Anyway! live laugh love, look at the delicious food I ate for dinner.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="krabi"> 26-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Early rise and early escape, very happy to be leaving the hostel and moving on. It was a lot of fun to ride one of those open buses that you can dangle your head out of. Scenery was beautiful. We’re only staying in Krabi 2 nights as a mini pit stop before heading out to one of the islands. We’re currently undecided on which one to aim for. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Open Bus.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">The day was feeling really productive, we checked in early, showered, did some washing and headed out with a little to-do list and ready to explore. Thus far we had done well to ignore our cravings for familiar food, but my quest to find salt and vinegar crisps had been unsuccessful and Alex wanted a meal that would touch the sides of his stomach and rice/ noodles wasn't cutting it anymore. Feeling as though we were in safe hands at the sight of HP sauce on the table, we made the united decision to order western food. Alex chose an American style breakfast, I went for a ham and cheese toastie. First red flag was being told they had no toasties, but I could have a grilled cheese sandwich. I should have turned back then. Both our meals were awful. Admittedly not the worst thing we’ve eaten here, but by far the most disappointing. We were near heartbroken, my toastie imposter had fake cheese, and Alex had a giant plate with 1 sausage, 2 rashes of bacon and 1 fried piece of ham rolling about. There were also 2 dry pieces of bread disguised as toast and 2 eggs with runny whites and hard yolks. We tried our best to get over it quickly. Alex was of course, still hungry.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The next few hours were a big success, we sorted out a sim card for my phone, stocked up on toiletries and explored the food market in and around Krabi town. We tried takoyaki and different meat skewers, watched our chicken with cashew nuts get fried up in a wok and even found mini banana bread cupcakes! </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Lady Cooking.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then Alex took us on an exciting tour of every single ATM in Krabi searching at first for one that didn't charge a flat rate of 220 THB, they all do, and then for one with a better exchange rate. It was no use. After accepting these facts and in defeat trying to withdraw the maximum amount of money, as to minimize the amount of withdrawals we would need in the future, we then realized that our international bank card has its own set limit of £300 per withdrawal. Alex then kicked the ATM and declared we would be leaving Thailand tomorrow! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I think that’s highly unlikely but please wait on bated breath for the next update. In the meantime enjoy this picture of happier times before the search for the mythical ATM machine. We didn't know how to pay for the photo booth so settled on taking a picture outside it.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 25-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had planned to go to a ‘secret beach’ but since waking up it has rained on and off all day. After doing nothing yesterday I was going a little stir crazy so we ventured out for food. Same question as last time ‘left or right?’ Only 2 directions to walk in because there’s only 1 road… the ‘off the beaten track’ gimmick got old quick. This time we went left. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After 45 minutes walking down the one and only road, it did get more interesting with a lackluster ‘tourist promenade’. There was only one place open for food and a scattering of shops. I think we were the first customers to enter those shops in 10 years. We went into three shops, on the hunt for salt and vinegar crisps, and they got increasingly weird. The first shop only felt abandoned, the shelves were sparse and dusty but there was an actual shopkeeper at a till. In the second shop there was nobody inside except a woman asleep on the floor, and the individually wrapped sandwiches had an infestation of those teeny tiny bugs I see everywhere. The third shop was legitimately abandoned, but by this point i’d already eaten the banana sponge cake I’d bought from the 1st shop, and wanted to try the coconut one I’d found in the 3rd, so we awkwardly waited and shuffled about barefoot until someone spotted us from the adjoining house. It felt as though we’d walked off the map in a game. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Snack Haul.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">There was hardly any traffic to go past us on that last stretch of the road, and by the time we had been inside the shops the only thing around besides ourselves was 1 scooter ferrying a woman in a sidecar. The scooter sounded like it was being run on washing up liquid. I don’t think an actual bubble machine sounds as much like a bubble machine as that scooter did. Pop pop pop as it turned the corner, barely moving faster than we walked. Alex was overjoyed when it went past a second time. It was so zany. Walking back and catching the monkeys hosting a roadside meeting barely registered as weird after everything else. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Monkey Road.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We didn’t do much else all day. For dinner we went to the only other place we hadn’t already gone to in a 10 mile radius. I was served up a steaming hot bowl of bean sprouts, and Alex got buzzed on undiluted strawberry syrup. Still our first glimpse into Thai television was interesting as we intently watched the foreign drama on TV above our heads. Understood absolutely nothing about what was going on, watched regardless, little chuckle when the lizard crawling across the screen lined up with someone’s face. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our recent interactions with locals has been very limited as language has proved to be a big barrier, we usually just smile politely and point at the menu to order food, which is exactly how it had gone this time (with less success because I obviously didn’t want a heap of bean sprouts for dinner). The woman serving was very reserved and quiet, up until the point she launched a melon at our table and couldn’t stop laughing. I think she accidentally dropped it when tidying up the fruit display but it hit our table with such force that Alex and I both shot upright in our chairs. It really tickled her up and the three of us took turns laughing for ages afterwards. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 24-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">I somehow slept worse than the night before, it is never quiet, also I have 7 bites on my legs! We agreed on hanging around the hostel and having a lazy day. Alex has promised to take more pictures of me, without me always having to ask, so here’s me in the hammock. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Erin Hammock.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">Fun and novel but not awfully comfortable to lie in, and as Alex discovered, not easy to jump out of quickly when there’s a monkey trying to steal your stuff! The monkeys have gotten bold today. One snuck up on Alex’s bag when he was in the hammock and went to grab his water bottle, wish I'd have gotten a photo of the moment Alex snatched it back from him. The monkey looked shocked! Pulled such a surprised face with his mouth wide open before backing away. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The war between dog and monkey has also escalated. We were sat eating lunch when we saw a very organized advance from the monkeys, one went in first as bait for the dogs, drawing their attention to the jetty as the others ascended on the hostel slowly. I wonder if the owner of the hostel calculated exactly how many dogs he would need to ward off a population of monkeys. It took every wagging tail to keep them back today. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Monkey.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">The book I'm reading is increasingly disappointing and with little else to do I went for a daytime nap, glad I did because I'm in for my worst night yet. I’m not super scared of much, but I am absolutely terrified of rodents. My biggest fear has come true, there is some sort of mouse or rat living in the roof of our hut. We haven’t seen it, but I can’t think what else the noise could be. The mosquito net will provide no comfort, as surely it could chew straight through? I can’t cope. Alex will have to knock me out tonight. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="11">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="jan-week3"> 23-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Heard lots of miscellaneous nature noises all night. There's also a giant cage full of birds at the entrance to the hostel that look like parrots except they don't talk, which might have been cute, no, instead they just make an awful racket. Of course there is also the familiar early morning calling from the mosque. Slept horrendously. I've also been eaten alive and I can't understand how because I haven't really seen any flies and we slept under a mosquito net.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We rented a kayak to take out to the island, the distance was very deceiving. It took 30 minutes of relentless paddling to reach the first island that doesn't even have a beach to stop on. Alex wouldn't allow any breaks, not even to enjoy the view as we were 'losing ground'. It was not fun. We got to the second island after another 15 minutes which is supposedly 'Monkey Island' but we've seen more monkeys at the hostel than there! Alex cut his foot quite badly on some rocks whilst swimming, then threw a paddy because he expected clearer water for his efforts. I still thought it was a nice little alcove, especially when the sun shone through the clouds.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Monkey Beach.jpg">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Bleeding Foot.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex had just finished getting angry over me frolicking with the camera on unusually boggy sand, where I could 'easily have tripped and dropped the camera onto a rock' (an unlikely worst case scenario) when a giant killer wasp started checking out our kayak. I have since googled and discovered it is called an Eastern Cicada Killer. The thing was honestly so big, I think it was attracted by the scent of fresh blood. On the small beach there wasn't anywhere for us to go so we waded into the water hugging each other and anxiously waiting for the first move towards us. It came, we both panicked and then Alex did the unthinkable: he pushed me into the wasp, away from himself. I screamed and cut my foot on a rock falling. The wasp promptly left us alone then. Alex swears he pushed me only to bat the wasp away. It has caused a rift between us. Trust has been lost, and I'm not willing to put myself in that danger again for him to prove himself. I joke, but he did really do that, and it did really make me cry for a bit.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Killer Wasp.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">The paddle back was easier but we still slept for 3 hours afterwards. Then we got caught in another rainstorm whilst out for food. Pathetically, I did get a little chilly out in the rain, but the walk back was worth it. Lightning lit up the sky sporadically from different directions.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">I think we took it for granted in Malaysia how fluent everyone that we met was in speaking English. I read this morning that Thailand’s English proficiency ranking among non-native English speaking countries has been ranked one of the lowest. I had suspected as much from the bus transfers the other day when we were addressed only by ‘ao nang?’
							<br>*we nod our heads*
							<br>then a point ‘ao nang’
							<br>hastily grabbing our bags to move to the pointed at bus
							<br>‘ao nang?’
							<br>*another nod of our heads
							<br>‘ao nang’
							<br>*gets on bus*
							</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">If more confirmation was needed then it came today. We ordered our taxi from our airbnb to take us to the hostel. As promised ‘The bananas, off the beaten track’ was in fact off the beaten track and so not a very appealing journey for the taxi who once seeing our destination tried to cancel. We then strenuously tried to communicate an agreed upon new price, with the driver having to speak into google translate, Alex typing back and then also having to communicate we needed to hop onto his hotspot to cancel the journey on the app. We got there in the end.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our hostel is perfect, very relaxing. Our hut is made from bamboo, there are hammocks and benches everywhere, monkeys in the trees and kayaks to rent. Alex immediately went to extend our stay from 2 days to 4. I think he wants to settle down for a little bit and go slower. </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Alex at Hostel.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Since getting here we’ve sat down in the common area playing rummikub and hanamikoji and wandered down the road a short distance for dinner. We walked past some children playing who called out to us, we waved and said hello, they returned the greeting but then also shouted ‘potato’. We walked past them a second time and the bravest introduced himself, so we told them our names. They were happy to try out ‘Alex’ but I got blank stares for my name, I don't think they liked it.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">There's a wooden pier here and apparently when it’s high tide at night there’s fluorescent plankton! Really hope we get to go swimming and see.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Sat here writing whilst Alex works on the website and finally we’re experiencing a rainstorm! I don't know how we avoided it so long, it sounds lovely on the bamboo roof we’re sitting under. Feeling very cosy and relaxed, our sandles left outside however are getting soaked.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We both didn't sleep well last night, Alex reckons it's because the air conditioning made so much noise it sounded like the building was going to fall down. It also pissed out water the entire night, luckily Alex in a sleepy daze moved his bag from underneath after the first drop.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had an argument this morning with our toothbrushes still in, comedic relief didn't come until after. I can't even remember what the argument was over now.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The promised sunshine came so we took a long tail boat to Railay Beach. Filled our bellies with pad Thai, spring rolls and samosas before lazing around swimming and napping on the sand. I think there was something in the water, Alex isn't sure but both of us whilst swimming felt stings like tiny bug bites, sometimes it would really hurt. No idea what it could be.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">My bracelet gains another bead, the Indian Ocean: completed. Although Alex would like to note that technically it was the Andaman sea that we were in.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Railey.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">On the boat back we met some fabulous Thai ladies, then we played our made up game sharks and spoons in the pool together. Alex got a little too playful and tried to hold me down in the water and in my panic I kicked him as hard as I could square in the chest. No hard feelings.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We took a night time nature trail on our way to dinner (5 minutes around the corner). Spotted 4 dogs, 2 cats, 2 lizards and 2 toads!</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">I've been ordering Thai tea as a replacement for my regular brew, it does usually taste a bit different but the one I had tonight tasted exactly like how incense sticks smell. Specifically those strong Indian ones Nag Champa, If you’re still not sure what I mean then walk into Salsa's, Warrington.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I think we are finally in the habit of staying awake all day now! Alex may be asleep next to me fully dressed and with his phone still in his hand, but it's 10pm so he's fared well.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Went to the office we booked our bus to Krabi with at 5am and the bus wasn't there. Alex went through the works, we called the 3 different numbers for them, none answered. I sat patiently like a faithful dog, Alex stressed. After 30 long minutes it finally turned up! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were bundled in and out of 3 different buses and the final and worse bus typically was the one we'd be in the longest. 11 hrs in total spent upright on a bus seat smaller than the ones on a plane. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We crossed the border easily at least, and our airbnb is right by the jetty to visit Railey beach. We took a dip in the swimming pool here but the water wasn't clear and started to irritate Alex's skin. Alex also started to lose his mind because he couldn't plug the adapter into any of the sockets because on every single plug socket in our room is a closely placed switch. He was really panicking and for some reason all I could do was giggle. He found one behind the TV from the 80s.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">First impressions of thailand: people will carry anything on a scooter.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The weather has been very overcast, Alex told me to be patient. I was promised a paradise so I expect sun and blue skies for tomorrow!</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">The bus to Penang was peachy but by god I have some higher force to thank for surviving the taxi to Georgetown. Absolutely terrifying, it feels like every time we're in a taxi we're living off borrowed time. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Penang is really pretty, I've included the picture taken of the road our airbnb is on. Chinese New Year is only 3 days away so all the streets and shrines are decorated. Our host recommended a food market for lunch, I got a delicious clay pot chicken. We went back for dinner it was so nice. By far the two yummiest meals I‘ve had yet.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Penang\Street.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">I know that after hallucinating a spider the other night that I've lost some credibility but I swear I saw an alligator today! Alex doesn't believe me and it had swam away by the time I called him back to look. It was in really shallow murky water.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Penang\Jetty.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex makes us walk everywhere and lies about how long journeys will take, even though it was so much hotter than in the Cameron Highlands. I complain lots and will only be pacified by frequent breaks. It was during one of our pit stops when we found 'Adore Art Cafe'. Had the nicest fresh apple juice, we literally watched as he cut and blended a full apple. So sooo good, I could really taste the granny smith, and Alex joined a band! (He went shy)</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Penang\Adore cafe.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">The next 2 hours were spent in Alex's personal hell of a shopping mall turned bus station with a 4 lane main road running through the middle. We walked round and round in circles trying to find a coach company that could take us to Krabi, Thailand tomorrow. I trailed behind still buzzed from my apple juice, role playing race across the world. I thought Alex might have imploded first but we did eventually find somewhere.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Thailand tomorrow! Very excited. We've already booked 2 nights in an airbnb and 2 nights in an 'off the beaten track' hostel in Ao Nang.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Leaving Penang on a positive note.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Last night I had a sleepy hallucination where I saw a spindly looking spider right in front of my face as I was falling asleep, when I jumped up and flashed my torch around I couldn't see anything. It happened again when I was actually asleep but I seemed to know that wasn't real and didn't panic. So far the only creepers that have bothered me are the tiny bugs I saw on that first night, they're everywhere.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We hired a scooter for the morning expecting to sight-see all the farms and plantations but instead we fell into the twilight zone. The highly recommended Lavender Garden ended up being a tiny tourist trap made from plastic and bright paint. We wondered about roadside souvenir shops selling plastic decorative garlic and themed Jaws cards...without the theme. It felt so bizarre and illusory. There was also a 'time tunnel' museum which looked like rooms full of old tat but after being ripped off so brazenly by the Lavender Garden we didn't bother.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">With nothing better to do we took our chances with the butterfly farm which was actually quite cool. It did get overwhelming quite quickly, and Alex was freaked out because some of the butterflies had broken wings and he was preoccupied by the idea that something in there was stalking the shadows ready to clip his wings too, in fairness there were giant spiders in boxes randomly scattered around. The butterfly farm had an unadvertised regular farm in the back with all sorts of mad animals, and a dirty looking aquarium.</p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\Butterfly 2.jpg">
					
							<p class="diary-entries">Next we met up with a few people from yesterday's walk and took an 'illegal' walk in the mossy forest lookalike (apparently it wasn't the mossy forest). Our hostel gave us directions but a tour guide on the trail told us we couldn't enter without a guide, unsurprisingly. We carried on 'at our own risk' and only took 20 minutes. Here's Alex first to reach the top, posed proudly with the flag.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\Alex Flag.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">Me and Alex have taken to winking a lot at each other and making games from anything i.e guessing which foot Alex is tapping under the table. I think we are bored. Similar to KL, our stay at Cameron Highlands felt like one day too many.</p>
						</div>

						<div id="5">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" style="margin-top: 80px;"> 17-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">The morning hike ended up being a great decision, even if it was far more intensive than expected. Took us 4 hrs in total, in a group of 9. Me and Alex accidentally dressed matching, green shorts white t, just in case there was any doubt we were together. We were the only 2 to not get covered in mud, which was lucky because we were also the least equipped, everyone had teased me over my freshly cleaned white trainers but they held up well. At one point Alex went rogue and decided he would jump down onto precarious platforms to get down a steep section rather than shuffle down holding a rope, which would have been fine if he hadn’t recommended others to try. The first, and last person to try following his lead almost missed the platform entirely, landed on her stomach and in doing so threw her water bottle (which Alex thankfully caught). She wasn’t hurt, out of everyone she fell the most anyway. At another point I was nearly pushed off the edge helping someone up, the fall would have killed us both and I was holding her entire body weight with both hands. Somehow we all made it up to the top for a nice group picture, and with only half the group making a wrong turn we all made it back down to the cafe at the bottom where I finally, after 6 days, got to enjoy a cup of tea. </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\Rope Climb.jpg">
					
							<p class="diary-entries">The caveat to making it back to the hostel however was that we needed to hitchhike. The volunteer at the hostel said it was the norm and everyone gets picked up within 5 minutes. We must have stood there waving and smiling at cars for over 45 minutes before anyone got a ride. I feel like it was my impromptu dance that got us ours. We got in the back of a lovely Malaysian womens car who was driving with her tiny 1 yrs old baby.</p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\Alex Hiking Tea.jpg">
			
							<p class="diary-entries">We got food with our newly made friend and invited them to join our team for the trivia quiz in the evening, then back at the hostel one of the girls from the hike bought cake to celebrate her birthday so we had some of that. I outed Alex’s party trick of naming the capital city of every country, he tried to act embarrassed but I know he enjoyed everyone firing countries at him and getting them all right.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\A+E in Tea.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">Needless to say our team, Air Heads, comprising of me, Alex and our very quirky friend won the trivia quiz. Alex did most of the work but I feel like I filled in the gaps nicely. We won a can of beer each and the overall losers had to try durian. The hostel still smells of it now. The quiz felt a little biased since it was the Scottish volunteer that chose the questions, however we forgot the national animal of Scotland anyway. I say our friend was quirky, they’re very upfront and outspoken, another team asked what a mammal was for the question ‘which is the only mammal that can fly’ and they announced ‘birds lay eggs, mammals push babies out of vagina’. They also said ‘wow they must know nothing’ about the losing team. They are French, so rather than it being rude it comes across as cool and edgy.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">That’s all for today folks! I showed the pictures from today's Hike to my Mum and she said it looks like the UK :)</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Day 1 staying in a hostel. Getting the coach to the Cameron Highlands went smoothly. Freaked Alex out when I told him I could read his mind then proceeded to guess correctly what number from 1 to 10 he was thinking of, then what colour, and then what card from a deck! We had to stop there because Alex looked like he might cry, it’s never a good sign when someone starts questioning ‘This isn’t real’ referring to reality.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The hostel is nice and clean but I feel uncomfortable and unbearably shy. Alex has signed us up to do a morning hike with anyone else that wants to join but I'm praying he changes his mind. More good food, and now considering we missed our usual siesta I think we’ll go to bed early.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Feeling excited to explore the town and surrounding farms tomorrow, and we may even decide, very tentatively, to be a little sociable. Alex however has a dry cough and thinks his wisdom teeth may be pushing through so maybe we won’t!</p>

						<div id="3">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" style="margin-top: 80px;"> 15-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Early start, wanted to visit the Batu Caves before it got busy. Alex made us rush to catch a train that actually wasn’t due for another 20 minutes. Still, it is always good to check your cardiovascular health, a workout from hell. The batu caves were worth the visit for only £1 each for the train and free entry inside. Think I prefer big statues to big buildings, will seek out more.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Kuala Lumpur\Batu Caves.jpg" alt="Batu Caves">
							<p class="diary-entries">Lunch was unexpectedly adventurous. I ordered a bowl of noodles the same as the woman next to me was eating because it looked good, without realizing all the meat was random offcuts from a cow. We successfully identified a tongue and an artery…or vein? The rest was so bizarre we had no idea. There was a dry looking slice of meat that had the consistency of an undercooked courgette, and cubes that looked like liver but were tasteless and very much like jelly, and a beaten up pale meat that tasted like chicken. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">We did a little wandering and then ordered our first grab taxi to go to Masjid Wilayah Persekutuan (The Federal Territory Mosque). Without a moment's hesitation we were scooped up from the entrance and taken in. I had thought my full length trousers and long shirt that I had worn for visiting the Batu Caves was respectful enough but I was given a pink abaya and a head scarf to wear. Don’t think the look suited me but I was happy with the colour choices. The tour was really interesting, Azlin took us around, explaining the buildings architecture and religion. A few assumptions were made, "We all agree that there is one God right?" *Reluctantly nods head like sheep* I won’t be converting to Islam anytime soon but it was great to learn and get some pictures. Our volunteer tour guide gave us her contact details before we left in case we ever got into any trouble and needed help. Apparently it wasn’t just a kind gesture because whilst we were there a woman turned up after having her bag stolen with her passport inside. </p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Alex’s cool facade has finally cracked and I watched as stress visibly seeped in. We went to Jalan Alor for dinner, a busy food street. Food was incredible and we maybe got carried away ordering dishes to try so the total was more than expected and pushed us over budget. We’d also slept in the afternoon again and not headed out until late and Alex was anxious to pack before morning.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries"> Day 2 in Kuala Lumpur. Rocky start, woke up after a terrible nightmare and then found my toothbrush that I left out by the sink last night (without its plastic topper on) covered in teeny tiny bugs, freaked out and had to get my hunky man to shake them all off. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> Cheered up very quickly when we made it to our morning slot for the rooftop pool. Absolutely incredible view and it felt so good to swim. We got there not long after sunrise so really got to appreciate the sun moving higher and temperature slowly rising. We had the pool entirely to ourselves for the first 15 minutes, and then were joined by only 2 others. Cannot wait for our evening slot tomorrow so we can see all the buildings lit up.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Kuala Lumpur\Alex in Pool.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries"> We headed out without a plan and made our way towards the Petronas Towers. I was feeling really upbeat initially but very quickly felt overwhelmed and anxious, little food stalls and markets were crowded and with all the cars and scooters about too I was worried about getting in someone's way. We got food from a place that had the atmosphere and layout of a school canteen, and was served some variation of a nasi lemak. I didn’t get a picture because it looked as unappealing as it tasted, however Alex inhaled all of his, and then some of mine. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> We walked past a really beautiful cemetery. It was filled with so many different plants, and was well looked after. You can see from the pictures but I think it looked especially beautiful because it was surrounded by the city buildings, whilst being incredibly green, vibrant and peaceful. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Kuala Lumpur\Graveyard with PT.jpg">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Kuala Lumpur\Graveyard.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries"> We sat in KLCC park whilst I lost my body weight in sweat and Alex sat beside me smiling and relaxed, then we bought a sim card, drank pepsi that tasted completely different to usual, and then ventured into Chinatown. Food again was a little strange, but even so I managed to get some on me. Now my white shorts have splashes of orange which I need to clean asap before Alex can question why in the hell I brought white shorts in the first place. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> We bought iced watermelon smoothies, Alex’s came with tapioca pearls which he very impressively was able to shoot into my mouth from his straw. Then we thankfully got the train back and I fell asleep for the remainder of the afternoon. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> Alex booked our bus tickets to the Cameron Highlands, and I reluctantly booked our first hostel stay in a shared dorm with capsule beds. Trying to be as open minded as Alex, who so far has not been phased by anything. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="1">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="january-date"> 13-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">I don't want to write about the goodbye. I can’t think about it in retrospect because it still hurts. Alex did a great job comforting me, even if he did literally have to drag me onto the plane crying. The food on flight was relatively nice, however Alex’s Dad had set expectations high.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> Since landing we’ve gotten a bus, a coach and a train to get to the airbnb apartment, which has only given chance for the overall impression that Kuala Lumpur is tropical and green. Very green. The room is nice, Alex spoke to the other flatmate staying in a different room, Joe from Jakarta.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went back downstairs where they have a few shops, koi fish pond and cafe just to get water then we were showered and asleep. Alex hadn’t managed to sleep at all on the flights so he was completely poleaxed. We slept through our time slot for the infinity swimming pool which was disappointing, made worse by the fact Alex did not neglect to wake us up promptly for his 3hr long speed awareness course. Mild argument ensued, I felt that only half waking someone up to ask the question ‘do you want to be asleep?’ was not a fair way of deciding whether I wanted to wake up to go swimming, but this isn’t a courtroom and I apparently did say that yes, I wanted to sleep.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">That’s all I have to say about the day, hardly an exciting start but an entire day of traveling was never going to make the highlights, however I am preemptively going to mention before Alex proof reads and uploads to the website, that we got the Boeing 787-10 and it was very impressive even if i did forget to get the pictures of it that he asked for. We also got a view of the second largest building in the world from the window of the coach. I will let Alex pass final judgement on which, the plane or the building, was most impressive in his opinion. </p>
