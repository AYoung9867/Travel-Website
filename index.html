						<h1 class="diary-title"> DIARY ENTRIES <h1>
						
						<h2 class="diary-dates" id="january-date"> 13-01-23</h2>
						<p class="diary-entries">I don't want to write about the goodbye. I can’t think about it in retrospect because it still hurts. Alex did a great job comforting me, even if he did literally have to drag me onto the plane crying. The food on flight was relatively nice, however Alex’s Dad had set expectations high.</p>
						<p class="diary-entries"> Since landing we’ve gotten a bus, a coach and a train to get to the airbnb apartment, which has only given chance for the overall impression that Kuala Lumpur is tropical and green. Very green. The room is nice, Alex spoke to the other flatmate staying in a different room, Joe from Jakarta.</p>
						<p class="diary-entries">We went back downstairs where they have a few shops, koi fish pond and cafe just to get water then we were showered and asleep. Alex hadn’t managed to sleep at all on the flights so he was completely poleaxed. We slept through our time slot for the infinity swimming pool which was disappointing, made worse by the fact Alex did not neglect to wake us up promptly for his 3hr long speed awareness course. Mild argument ensued, I felt that only half waking someone up to ask the question ‘do you want to be asleep?’ was not a fair way of deciding whether I wanted to wake up to go swimming, but this isn’t a courtroom and I apparently did say that yes, I wanted to sleep.</p>
						<p class="diary-entries">That’s all I have to say about the day, hardly an exciting start but an entire day of traveling was never going to make the highlights, however I am preemptively going to mention before Alex proof reads and uploads to the website, that we got the Boeing 787-10 and it was very impressive even if i did forget to get the pictures of it that he asked for. We also got a view of the second largest building in the world from the window of the coach. I will let Alex pass final judgement on which, the plane or the building, was most impressive in his opinion. </p>

						<h2 class="diary-dates"> 14-01-23</h2>
						<p class="diary-entries"> Day 2 in Kuala Lumpur. Rocky start, woke up after a terrible nightmare and then found my toothbrush that I left out by the sink last night (without its plastic topper on) covered in teeny tiny bugs, freaked out and had to get my hunky man to shake them all off. </p>
						<p class="diary-entries"> Cheered up very quickly when we made it to our morning slot for the rooftop pool. Absolutely incredible view and it felt so good to swim. We got there not long after sunrise so really got to appreciate the sun moving higher and temperature slowly rising. We had the pool entirely to ourselves for the first 15 minutes, and then were joined by only 2 others. Cannot wait for our evening slot tomorrow so we can see all the buildings lit up.</p>
						<img src="images\Diary Images\Alex in Pool.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool" style="width: 40%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
						<p class="diary-entries"> We headed out without a plan and made our way towards the Petronas Towers. I was feeling really upbeat initially but very quickly felt overwhelmed and anxious, little food stalls and markets were crowded and with all the cars and scooters about too I was worried about getting in someone's way. We got food from a place that had the atmosphere and layout of a school canteen, and was served some variation of a nasi lemak. I didn’t get a picture because it looked as unappealing as it tasted, however Alex inhaled all of his, and then some of mine. </p>
						<p class="diary-entries"> We walked past a really beautiful cemetery. It was filled with so many different plants, and was well looked after. You can see from the pictures but I think it looked especially beautiful because it was surrounded by the city buildings, whilst being incredibly green, vibrant and peaceful. </p>

						<p class="diary-entries"> We sat in KLCC park whilst I lost my body weight in sweat and Alex sat beside me smiling and relaxed, then we bought a sim card, drank pepsi that tasted completely different to usual, and then ventured into Chinatown. Food again was a little strange, but even so I managed to get some on me. Now my white shorts have splashes of orange which I need to clean asap before Alex can question why in the hell I brought white shorts in the first place. </p>
						<p class="diary-entries"> We bought iced watermelon smoothies, Alex’s came with tapioca pearls which he very impressively was able to shoot into my mouth from his straw. Then we thankfully got the train back and I fell asleep for the remainder of the afternoon. </p>
						<p class="diary-entries"> Alex booked our bus tickets to the Cameron Highlands, and I reluctantly booked our first hostel stay in a shared dorm with capsule beds. Trying to be as open minded as Alex, who so far has not been phased by anything. </p>
		
						<h2 class="diary-dates" style="margin-top: 80px;"> 15-01-23</h2>
						<p class="diary-entries">Early start, wanted to visit the Batu Caves before it got busy. Alex made us rush to catch a train that actually wasn’t due for another 20 minutes. Still, it is always good to check your cardiovascular health, a workout from hell. The batu caves were worth the visit for only £1 each for the train and free entry inside. Think I prefer big statues to big buildings, will seek out more.</p>
						<img src="images\Diary Images\Batu Caves.jpg" alt="Batu Caves" style="width: 40%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
						<p class="diary-entries">Lunch was unexpectedly adventurous. I ordered a bowl of noodles the same as the woman next to me was eating because it looked good, without realizing all the meat was random offcuts from a cow. We successfully identified a tongue and an artery…or vein? The rest was so bizarre we had no idea. There was a dry looking slice of meat that had the consistency of an undercooked courgette, and cubes that looked like liver but were tasteless and very much like jelly, and a beaten up pale meat that tasted like chicken. Alex went in like a mad man, but I did eventually try everything too. The tongue tasted like condensed kidney which was really not nice, but everything else was fine. Alex liked the bits of crackling on top most.</p>

						<p class="diary-entries">We did a little wandering and then ordered our first grab taxi to go to Masjid Wilayah Persekutuan (The Federal Territory Mosque). Without a moment's hesitation we were scooped up from the entrance and taken in. I had thought my full length trousers and long shirt that I had worn for visiting the Batu Caves was respectful enough but I was given a pink abaya and a head scarf to wear. Don’t think the look suited me but I was happy with the colour choices. The tour was really interesting, ….. took us around, explaining the buildings architecture and religion. I won’t be converting to Islam anytime soon but it was great to learn and get some pictures. Our volunteer tour guide gave us her contact details before we left in case we ever got into any trouble and needed help. Apparently it wasn’t just a kind gesture because whilst we were there a woman turned up after having her bag stolen with her passport inside. </p>

						<p class="diary-entries">Alex’s cool facade has finally cracked and I watched as stress visibly seeped in. We went to Jalan Alor for dinner, a busy food street. Food was incredible and we maybe got carried away ordering dishes to try so the total was more than expected and pushed us over budget. We’d also slept in the afternoon again and not headed out until late and Alex was anxious to pack before morning.</p>

						<p class="diary-entries">In other important news, I rigorously scrubbed clean my shorts. The fashion show continues.</p>

						<h2 class="diary-dates" style="margin-top: 80px;"> 16-01-23</h2>
						<p class="diary-entries">Day 1 staying in a hostel. Getting the coach to the Cameron Highlands went smoothly. Freaked Alex out when I told him I could read his mind then proceeded to guess correctly what number from 1 to 10 he was thinking of, then what colour, and then what card from a deck! We had to stop there because Alex looked like he might cry, it’s never a good sign when someone starts questioning ‘This isn’t real’ referring to reality.</p>
						<p class="diary-entries">The hostel is nice and clean but I feel uncomfortable and unbearably shy. Alex has signed us up to do a morning hike with anyone else that wants to join but I'm praying he changes his mind. More good food, and now considering we missed our usual siesta I think we’ll go to bed early.</p>
						<p class="diary-entries">Feeling excited to explore the town and surrounding farms tomorrow, and we may even decide, very tentatively, to be a little sociable. Alex however has a dry cough and thinks his wisdom teeth may be pushing through so maybe we won’t!</p>
