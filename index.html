							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="january-date"> 13-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">I don't want to write about the goodbye. I can’t think about it in retrospect because it still hurts. Alex did a great job comforting me, even if he did literally have to drag me onto the plane crying. The food on flight was relatively nice, however Alex’s Dad had set expectations high.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> Since landing we’ve gotten a bus, a coach and a train to get to the airbnb apartment, which has only given chance for the overall impression that Kuala Lumpur is tropical and green. Very green. The room is nice, Alex spoke to the other flatmate staying in a different room, Joe from Jakarta.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went back downstairs where they have a few shops, koi fish pond and cafe just to get water then we were showered and asleep. Alex hadn’t managed to sleep at all on the flights so he was completely poleaxed. We slept through our time slot for the infinity swimming pool which was disappointing, made worse by the fact Alex did not neglect to wake us up promptly for his 3hr long speed awareness course. Mild argument ensued, I felt that only half waking someone up to ask the question ‘do you want to be asleep?’ was not a fair way of deciding whether I wanted to wake up to go swimming, but this isn’t a courtroom and I apparently did say that yes, I wanted to sleep.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">That’s all I have to say about the day, hardly an exciting start but an entire day of traveling was never going to make the highlights, however I am preemptively going to mention before Alex proof reads and uploads to the website, that we got the Boeing 787-10 and it was very impressive even if i did forget to get the pictures of it that he asked for. We also got a view of the second largest building in the world from the window of the coach. I will let Alex pass final judgement on which, the plane or the building, was most impressive in his opinion. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 14-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries"> Day 2 in Kuala Lumpur. Rocky start, woke up after a terrible nightmare and then found my toothbrush that I left out by the sink last night (without its plastic topper on) covered in teeny tiny bugs, freaked out and had to get my hunky man to shake them all off. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> Cheered up very quickly when we made it to our morning slot for the rooftop pool. Absolutely incredible view and it felt so good to swim. We got there not long after sunrise so really got to appreciate the sun moving higher and temperature slowly rising. We had the pool entirely to ourselves for the first 15 minutes, and then were joined by only 2 others. Cannot wait for our evening slot tomorrow so we can see all the buildings lit up.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Kuala Lumpur\Alex in Pool.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries"> We headed out without a plan and made our way towards the Petronas Towers. I was feeling really upbeat initially but very quickly felt overwhelmed and anxious, little food stalls and markets were crowded and with all the cars and scooters about too I was worried about getting in someone's way. We got food from a place that had the atmosphere and layout of a school canteen, and was served some variation of a nasi lemak. I didn’t get a picture because it looked as unappealing as it tasted, however Alex inhaled all of his, and then some of mine. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> We walked past a really beautiful cemetery. It was filled with so many different plants, and was well looked after. You can see from the pictures but I think it looked especially beautiful because it was surrounded by the city buildings, whilst being incredibly green, vibrant and peaceful. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Kuala Lumpur\Graveyard with PT.jpg">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Kuala Lumpur\Graveyard.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries"> We sat in KLCC park whilst I lost my body weight in sweat and Alex sat beside me smiling and relaxed, then we bought a sim card, drank pepsi that tasted completely different to usual, and then ventured into Chinatown. Food again was a little strange, but even so I managed to get some on me. Now my white shorts have splashes of orange which I need to clean asap before Alex can question why in the hell I brought white shorts in the first place. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> We bought iced watermelon smoothies, Alex’s came with tapioca pearls which he very impressively was able to shoot into my mouth from his straw. Then we thankfully got the train back and I fell asleep for the remainder of the afternoon. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries"> Alex booked our bus tickets to the Cameron Highlands, and I reluctantly booked our first hostel stay in a shared dorm with capsule beds. Trying to be as open minded as Alex, who so far has not been phased by anything. </p>

						<div id="3">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" style="margin-top: 80px;"> 15-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Early start, wanted to visit the Batu Caves before it got busy. Alex made us rush to catch a train that actually wasn’t due for another 20 minutes. Still, it is always good to check your cardiovascular health, a workout from hell. The batu caves were worth the visit for only £1 each for the train and free entry inside. Think I prefer big statues to big buildings, will seek out more.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Kuala Lumpur\Batu Caves.jpg" alt="Batu Caves">
							<p class="diary-entries">Lunch was unexpectedly adventurous. I ordered a bowl of noodles the same as the woman next to me was eating because it looked good, without realizing all the meat was random offcuts from a cow. We successfully identified a tongue and an artery…or vein? The rest was so bizarre we had no idea. There was a dry looking slice of meat that had the consistency of an undercooked courgette, and cubes that looked like liver but were tasteless and very much like jelly, and a beaten up pale meat that tasted like chicken. </p>

								<figcaption>Maybe tongue?</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex went in like a mad man, but I did eventually try everything too. The tongue tasted like condensed kidney which was really not nice, but everything else was fine. Alex liked the bits of crackling on top most.</p>

							</figure>
		
							<p class="diary-entries">We did a little wandering and then ordered our first grab taxi to go to Masjid Wilayah Persekutuan (The Federal Territory Mosque). Without a moment's hesitation we were scooped up from the entrance and taken in. I had thought my full length trousers and long shirt that I had worn for visiting the Batu Caves was respectful enough but I was given a pink abaya and a head scarf to wear. Don’t think the look suited me but I was happy with the colour choices. The tour was really interesting, Azlin took us around, explaining the buildings architecture and religion. A few assumptions were made, "We all agree that there is one God right?" *Reluctantly nods head like sheep* I won’t be converting to Islam anytime soon but it was great to learn and get some pictures. Our volunteer tour guide gave us her contact details before we left in case we ever got into any trouble and needed help. Apparently it wasn’t just a kind gesture because whilst we were there a woman turned up after having her bag stolen with her passport inside. </p>

							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Kuala Lumpur\Mosque Inside.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex’s cool facade has finally cracked and I watched as stress visibly seeped in. We went to Jalan Alor for dinner, a busy food street. Food was incredible and we maybe got carried away ordering dishes to try so the total was more than expected and pushed us over budget. We’d also slept in the afternoon again and not headed out until late and Alex was anxious to pack before morning.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="cameron-highlands" style="margin-top: 80px;"> 16-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Day 1 staying in a hostel. Getting the coach to the Cameron Highlands went smoothly. Freaked Alex out when I told him I could read his mind then proceeded to guess correctly what number from 1 to 10 he was thinking of, then what colour, and then what card from a deck! We had to stop there because Alex looked like he might cry, it’s never a good sign when someone starts questioning ‘This isn’t real’ referring to reality.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The hostel is nice and clean but I feel uncomfortable and unbearably shy. Alex has signed us up to do a morning hike with anyone else that wants to join but I'm praying he changes his mind. More good food, and now considering we missed our usual siesta I think we’ll go to bed early.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Feeling excited to explore the town and surrounding farms tomorrow, and we may even decide, very tentatively, to be a little sociable. Alex however has a dry cough and thinks his wisdom teeth may be pushing through so maybe we won’t!</p>
						</div>

						<div id="5">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" style="margin-top: 80px;"> 17-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">The morning hike ended up being a great decision, even if it was far more intensive than expected. Took us 4 hrs in total, in a group of 9. Me and Alex accidentally dressed matching, green shorts white t, just in case there was any doubt we were together. We were the only 2 to not get covered in mud, which was lucky because we were also the least equipped, everyone had teased me over my freshly cleaned white trainers but they held up well. At one point Alex went rogue and decided he would jump down onto precarious platforms to get down a steep section rather than shuffle down holding a rope, which would have been fine if he hadn’t recommended others to try. The first, and last person to try following his lead almost missed the platform entirely, landed on her stomach and in doing so threw her water bottle (which Alex thankfully caught). She wasn’t hurt, out of everyone she fell the most anyway. At another point I was nearly pushed off the edge helping someone up, the fall would have killed us both and I was holding her entire body weight with both hands. Somehow we all made it up to the top for a nice group picture, and with only half the group making a wrong turn we all made it back down to the cafe at the bottom where I finally, after 6 days, got to enjoy a cup of tea. </p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\Rope Climb.jpg">
					
							<p class="diary-entries">The caveat to making it back to the hostel however was that we needed to hitchhike. The volunteer at the hostel said it was the norm and everyone gets picked up within 5 minutes. We must have stood there waving and smiling at cars for over 45 minutes before anyone got a ride. I feel like it was my impromptu dance that got us ours. We got in the back of a lovely Malaysian womens car who was driving with her tiny 1 yrs old baby.</p>
	
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\All Hiking Tea.jpg">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\Alex Hiking Tea.jpg">
			
							<p class="diary-entries">We got food with our newly made friend and invited them to join our team for the trivia quiz in the evening, then back at the hostel one of the girls from the hike bought cake to celebrate her birthday so we had some of that. I outed Alex’s party trick of naming the capital city of every country, he tried to act embarrassed but I know he enjoyed everyone firing countries at him and getting them all right.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\A+E in Tea.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">Needless to say our team, Air Heads, comprising of me, Alex and our very quirky friend won the trivia quiz. Alex did most of the work but I feel like I filled in the gaps nicely. We won a can of beer each and the overall losers had to try durian. The hostel still smells of it now. The quiz felt a little biased since it was the Scottish volunteer that chose the questions, however we forgot the national animal of Scotland anyway. I say our friend was quirky, they’re very upfront and outspoken, another team asked what a mammal was for the question ‘which is the only mammal that can fly’ and they announced ‘birds lay eggs, mammals push babies out of vagina’. They also said ‘wow they must know nothing’ about the losing team. They are French, so rather than it being rude it comes across as cool and edgy.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">That’s all for today folks! I showed the pictures from today's Hike to my Mum and she said it looks like the UK :)</p>

						<div id="6">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" style="margin-top: 80px;"> 18-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Last night I had a sleepy hallucination where I saw a spindly looking spider right in front of my face as I was falling asleep, when I jumped up and flashed my torch around I couldn't see anything. It happened again when I was actually asleep but I seemed to know that wasn't real and didn't panic. So far the only creepers that have bothered me are the tiny bugs I saw on that first night, they're everywhere.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We hired a scooter for the morning expecting to sight-see all the farms and plantations but instead we fell into the twilight zone. The highly recommended Lavender Garden ended up being a tiny tourist trap made from plastic and bright paint. We wondered about roadside souvenir shops selling plastic decorative garlic and themed Jaws cards...without the theme. It felt so bizarre and illusory. There was also a 'time tunnel' museum which looked like rooms full of old tat but after being ripped off so brazenly by the Lavender Garden we didn't bother.</p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\Garlic.jpg">
						
							<p class="diary-entries">With nothing better to do we took our chances with the butterfly farm which was actually quite cool. It did get overwhelming quite quickly, and Alex was freaked out because some of the butterflies had broken wings and he was preoccupied by the idea that something in there was stalking the shadows ready to clip his wings too, in fairness there were giant spiders in boxes randomly scattered around. The butterfly farm had an unadvertised regular farm in the back with all sorts of mad animals, and a dirty looking aquarium.</p>
			
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\Butterfly 1.jpg">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\Butterfly 2.jpg">
					
							<p class="diary-entries">Next we met up with a few people from yesterday's walk and took an 'illegal' walk in the mossy forest lookalike (apparently it wasn't the mossy forest). Our hostel gave us directions but a tour guide on the trail told us we couldn't enter without a guide, unsurprisingly. We carried on 'at our own risk' and only took 20 minutes. Here's Alex first to reach the top, posed proudly with the flag.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Cameron Highlands\Alex Flag.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">Me and Alex have taken to winking a lot at each other and making games from anything i.e guessing which foot Alex is tapping under the table. I think we are bored. Similar to KL, our stay at Cameron Highlands felt like one day too many.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="7">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="penang" style="margin-top: 80px;"> 19-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">The bus to Penang was peachy but by god I have some higher force to thank for surviving the taxi to Georgetown. Absolutely terrifying, it feels like every time we're in a taxi we're living off borrowed time. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Penang is really pretty, I've included the picture taken of the road our airbnb is on. Chinese New Year is only 3 days away so all the streets and shrines are decorated. Our host recommended a food market for lunch, I got a delicious clay pot chicken. We went back for dinner it was so nice. By far the two yummiest meals I‘ve had yet.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Penang\Street.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">I know that after hallucinating a spider the other night that I've lost some credibility but I swear I saw an alligator today! Alex doesn't believe me and it had swam away by the time I called him back to look. It was in really shallow murky water.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Penang\Jetty.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex makes us walk everywhere and lies about how long journeys will take, even though it was so much hotter than in the Cameron Highlands. I complain lots and will only be pacified by frequent breaks. It was during one of our pit stops when we found 'Adore Art Cafe'. Had the nicest fresh apple juice, we literally watched as he cut and blended a full apple. So sooo good, I could really taste the granny smith, and Alex joined a band! (He went shy)</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Penang\Adore cafe.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">The next 2 hours were spent in Alex's personal hell of a shopping mall turned bus station with a 4 lane main road running through the middle. We walked round and round in circles trying to find a coach company that could take us to Krabi, Thailand tomorrow. I trailed behind still buzzed from my apple juice, role playing race across the world. I thought Alex might have imploded first but we did eventually find somewhere.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Thailand tomorrow! Very excited. We've already booked 2 nights in an airbnb and 2 nights in an 'off the beaten track' hostel in Ao Nang.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Leaving Penang on a positive note.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Went to the office we booked our bus to Krabi with at 5am and the bus wasn't there. Alex went through the works, we called the 3 different numbers for them, none answered. I sat patiently like a faithful dog, Alex stressed. After 30 long minutes it finally turned up! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We were bundled in and out of 3 different buses and the final and worse bus typically was the one we'd be in the longest. 11 hrs in total spent upright on a bus seat smaller than the ones on a plane. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We crossed the border easily at least, and our airbnb is right by the jetty to visit Railey beach. We took a dip in the swimming pool here but the water wasn't clear and started to irritate Alex's skin. Alex also started to lose his mind because he couldn't plug the adapter into any of the sockets because on every single plug socket in our room is a closely placed switch. He was really panicking and for some reason all I could do was giggle. He found one behind the TV from the 80s.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">First impressions of thailand: people will carry anything on a scooter.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The weather has been very overcast, Alex told me to be patient. I was promised a paradise so I expect sun and blue skies for tomorrow!</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 21-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We both didn't sleep well last night, Alex reckons it's because the air conditioning made so much noise it sounded like the building was going to fall down. It also pissed out water the entire night, luckily Alex in a sleepy daze moved his bag from underneath after the first drop.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had an argument this morning with our toothbrushes still in, comedic relief didn't come until after. I can't even remember what the argument was over now.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The promised sunshine came so we took a long tail boat to Railay Beach. Filled our bellies with pad Thai, spring rolls and samosas before lazing around swimming and napping on the sand. I think there was something in the water, Alex isn't sure but both of us whilst swimming felt stings like tiny bug bites, sometimes it would really hurt. No idea what it could be.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">My bracelet gains another bead, the Indian Ocean: completed. Although Alex would like to note that technically it was the Andaman sea that we were in.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Railey.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">On the boat back we met some fabulous Thai ladies, then we played our made up game sharks and spoons in the pool together. Alex got a little too playful and tried to hold me down in the water and in my panic I kicked him as hard as I could square in the chest. No hard feelings.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We took a night time nature trail on our way to dinner (5 minutes around the corner). Spotted 4 dogs, 2 cats, 2 lizards and 2 toads!</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Toad.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">I've been ordering Thai tea as a replacement for my regular brew, it does usually taste a bit different but the one I had tonight tasted exactly like how incense sticks smell. Specifically those strong Indian ones Nag Champa, If you’re still not sure what I mean then walk into Salsa's, Warrington.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I think we are finally in the habit of staying awake all day now! Alex may be asleep next to me fully dressed and with his phone still in his hand, but it's 10pm so he's fared well.</p>
						
						</div>
						
						<div id="10">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 22-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">I think we took it for granted in Malaysia how fluent everyone that we met was in speaking English. I read this morning that Thailand’s English proficiency ranking among non-native English speaking countries has been ranked one of the lowest. I had suspected as much from the bus transfers the other day when we were addressed only by ‘ao nang?’
							<br>*we nod our heads*
							<br>then a point ‘ao nang’
							<br>hastily grabbing our bags to move to the pointed at bus
							<br>‘ao nang?’
							<br>*another nod of our heads
							<br>‘ao nang’
							<br>*gets on bus*
							</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">If more confirmation was needed then it came today. We ordered our taxi from our airbnb to take us to the hostel. As promised ‘The bananas, off the beaten track’ was in fact off the beaten track and so not a very appealing journey for the taxi who once seeing our destination tried to cancel. We then strenuously tried to communicate an agreed upon new price, with the driver having to speak into google translate, Alex typing back and then also having to communicate we needed to hop onto his hotspot to cancel the journey on the app. We got there in the end.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our hostel is perfect, very relaxing. Our hut is made from bamboo, there are hammocks and benches everywhere, monkeys in the trees and kayaks to rent. Alex immediately went to extend our stay from 2 days to 4. I think he wants to settle down for a little bit and go slower. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Erin in Hut.jpg">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Alex at Hostel.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Since getting here we’ve sat down in the common area playing rummikub and hanamikoji and wandered down the road a short distance for dinner. We walked past some children playing who called out to us, we waved and said hello, they returned the greeting but then also shouted ‘potato’. We walked past them a second time and the bravest introduced himself, so we told them our names. They were happy to try out ‘Alex’ but I got blank stares for my name, I don't think they liked it.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">There's a wooden pier here and apparently when it’s high tide at night there’s fluorescent plankton! Really hope we get to go swimming and see.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Sat here writing whilst Alex works on the website and finally we’re experiencing a rainstorm! I don't know how we avoided it so long, it sounds lovely on the bamboo roof we’re sitting under. Feeling very cosy and relaxed, our sandles left outside however are getting soaked.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="jan-week3"> 23-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Heard lots of miscellaneous nature noises all night. There's also a giant cage full of birds at the entrance to the hostel that look like parrots except they don't talk, which might have been cute, no, instead they just make an awful racket. Of course there is also the familiar early morning calling from the mosque. Slept horrendously. I've also been eaten alive and I can't understand how because I haven't really seen any flies and we slept under a mosquito net.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We rented a kayak to take out to the island, the distance was very deceiving. It took 30 minutes of relentless paddling to reach the first island that doesn't even have a beach to stop on. Alex wouldn't allow any breaks, not even to enjoy the view as we were 'losing ground'. It was not fun. We got to the second island after another 15 minutes which is supposedly 'Monkey Island' but we've seen more monkeys at the hostel than there! Alex cut his foot quite badly on some rocks whilst swimming, then threw a paddy because he expected clearer water for his efforts. I still thought it was a nice little alcove, especially when the sun shone through the clouds.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Monkey Beach.jpg">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Bleeding Foot.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex had just finished getting angry over me frolicking with the camera on unusually boggy sand, where I could 'easily have tripped and dropped the camera onto a rock' (an unlikely worst case scenario) when a giant killer wasp started checking out our kayak. I have since googled and discovered it is called an Eastern Cicada Killer. The thing was honestly so big, I think it was attracted by the scent of fresh blood. On the small beach there wasn't anywhere for us to go so we waded into the water hugging each other and anxiously waiting for the first move towards us. It came, we both panicked and then Alex did the unthinkable: he pushed me into the wasp, away from himself. I screamed and cut my foot on a rock falling. The wasp promptly left us alone then. Alex swears he pushed me only to bat the wasp away. It has caused a rift between us. Trust has been lost, and I'm not willing to put myself in that danger again for him to prove himself. I joke, but he did really do that, and it did really make me cry for a bit.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Killer Wasp.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">The paddle back was easier but we still slept for 3 hours afterwards. Then we got caught in another rainstorm whilst out for food. Pathetically, I did get a little chilly out in the rain, but the walk back was worth it. Lightning lit up the sky sporadically from different directions.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 24-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">I somehow slept worse than the night before, it is never quiet, also I have 7 bites on my legs! We agreed on hanging around the hostel and having a lazy day. Alex has promised to take more pictures of me, without me always having to ask, so here’s me in the hammock. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Erin Hammock.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">Fun and novel but not awfully comfortable to lie in, and as Alex discovered, not easy to jump out of quickly when there’s a monkey trying to steal your stuff! The monkeys have gotten bold today. One snuck up on Alex’s bag when he was in the hammock and went to grab his water bottle, wish I'd have gotten a photo of the moment Alex snatched it back from him. The monkey looked shocked! Pulled such a surprised face with his mouth wide open before backing away. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The war between dog and monkey has also escalated. We were sat eating lunch when we saw a very organized advance from the monkeys, one went in first as bait for the dogs, drawing their attention to the jetty as the others ascended on the hostel slowly. I wonder if the owner of the hostel calculated exactly how many dogs he would need to ward off a population of monkeys. It took every wagging tail to keep them back today. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Monkey.jpg" alt="Alex in Pool">
							<p class="diary-entries">The book I'm reading is increasingly disappointing and with little else to do I went for a daytime nap, glad I did because I'm in for my worst night yet. I’m not super scared of much, but I am absolutely terrified of rodents. My biggest fear has come true, there is some sort of mouse or rat living in the roof of our hut. We haven’t seen it, but I can’t think what else the noise could be. The mosquito net will provide no comfort, as surely it could chew straight through? I can’t cope. Alex will have to knock me out tonight. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 25-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had planned to go to a ‘secret beach’ but since waking up it has rained on and off all day. After doing nothing yesterday I was going a little stir crazy so we ventured out for food. Same question as last time ‘left or right?’ Only 2 directions to walk in because there’s only 1 road… the ‘off the beaten track’ gimmick got old quick. This time we went left. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After 45 minutes walking down the one and only road, it did get more interesting with a lackluster ‘tourist promenade’. There was only one place open for food and a scattering of shops. I think we were the first customers to enter those shops in 10 years. We went into three shops, on the hunt for salt and vinegar crisps, and they got increasingly weird. The first shop only felt abandoned, the shelves were sparse and dusty but there was an actual shopkeeper at a till. In the second shop there was nobody inside except a woman asleep on the floor, and the individually wrapped sandwiches had an infestation of those teeny tiny bugs I see everywhere. The third shop was legitimately abandoned, but by this point i’d already eaten the banana sponge cake I’d bought from the 1st shop, and wanted to try the coconut one I’d found in the 3rd, so we awkwardly waited and shuffled about barefoot until someone spotted us from the adjoining house. It felt as though we’d walked off the map in a game. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Snack Haul.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">There was hardly any traffic to go past us on that last stretch of the road, and by the time we had been inside the shops the only thing around besides ourselves was 1 scooter ferrying a woman in a sidecar. The scooter sounded like it was being run on washing up liquid. I don’t think an actual bubble machine sounds as much like a bubble machine as that scooter did. Pop pop pop as it turned the corner, barely moving faster than we walked. Alex was overjoyed when it went past a second time. It was so zany. Walking back and catching the monkeys hosting a roadside meeting barely registered as weird after everything else. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Monkey Road.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We didn’t do much else all day. For dinner we went to the only other place we hadn’t already gone to in a 10 mile radius. I was served up a steaming hot bowl of bean sprouts, and Alex got buzzed on undiluted strawberry syrup. Still our first glimpse into Thai television was interesting as we intently watched the foreign drama on TV above our heads. Understood absolutely nothing about what was going on, watched regardless, little chuckle when the lizard crawling across the screen lined up with someone’s face. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our recent interactions with locals has been very limited as language has proved to be a big barrier, we usually just smile politely and point at the menu to order food, which is exactly how it had gone this time (with less success because I obviously didn’t want a heap of bean sprouts for dinner). The woman serving was very reserved and quiet, up until the point she launched a melon at our table and couldn’t stop laughing. I think she accidentally dropped it when tidying up the fruit display but it hit our table with such force that Alex and I both shot upright in our chairs. It really tickled her up and the three of us took turns laughing for ages afterwards. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="krabi"> 26-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Early rise and early escape, very happy to be leaving the hostel and moving on. It was a lot of fun to ride one of those open buses that you can dangle your head out of. Scenery was beautiful. We’re only staying in Krabi 2 nights as a mini pit stop before heading out to one of the islands. We’re currently undecided on which one to aim for. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Open Bus.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">The day was feeling really productive, we checked in early, showered, did some washing and headed out with a little to-do list and ready to explore. Thus far we had done well to ignore our cravings for familiar food, but my quest to find salt and vinegar crisps had been unsuccessful and Alex wanted a meal that would touch the sides of his stomach and rice/ noodles wasn't cutting it anymore. Feeling as though we were in safe hands at the sight of HP sauce on the table, we made the united decision to order western food. Alex chose an American style breakfast, I went for a ham and cheese toastie. First red flag was being told they had no toasties, but I could have a grilled cheese sandwich. I should have turned back then. Both our meals were awful. Admittedly not the worst thing we’ve eaten here, but by far the most disappointing. We were near heartbroken, my toastie imposter had fake cheese, and Alex had a giant plate with 1 sausage, 2 rashes of bacon and 1 fried piece of ham rolling about. There were also 2 dry pieces of bread disguised as toast and 2 eggs with runny whites and hard yolks. We tried our best to get over it quickly. Alex was of course, still hungry.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">The next few hours were a big success, we sorted out a sim card for my phone, stocked up on toiletries and explored the food market in and around Krabi town. We tried takoyaki and different meat skewers, watched our chicken with cashew nuts get fried up in a wok and even found mini banana bread cupcakes! </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Lady Cooking.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then Alex took us on an exciting tour of every single ATM in Krabi searching at first for one that didn't charge a flat rate of 220 THB, they all do, and then for one with a better exchange rate. It was no use. After accepting these facts and in defeat trying to withdraw the maximum amount of money, as to minimize the amount of withdrawals we would need in the future, we then realized that our international bank card has its own set limit of £300 per withdrawal. Alex then kicked the ATM and declared we would be leaving Thailand tomorrow! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">I think that’s highly unlikely but please wait on bated breath for the next update. In the meantime enjoy this picture of happier times before the search for the mythical ATM machine. We didn't know how to pay for the photo booth so settled on taking a picture outside it.</p>

						<div id="15">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 27-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Lay in bed feeling really sleepy and content. We’ve had a really good day, finished off with especially delicious food and now i’m exhausted and happy looking forward to a long undisturbed sleep. It really is a charmed life. I will have to save all the details from today to fill in tomorrow morning. Now I must sleep and think happy thoughts.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries" style="border-top: 20vh">We rented a scooter and went to the tiger cave temple. 1,260 very steep and uneven steps to ascend. We got there early just as several schools were getting back on the coaches. One girl called over that I was pretty and another asked for a photo with me. Then I was swarmed by school girls waiting to get pictures. I felt so awkward and self conscious but they were all so friendly I didn’t know how to say no. Think that's the most popular I’ll ever be. Two boys went to Alex and shook his hand, but when he introduced himself they giggled and ran off. It was an unexpected start to the day. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Climbing the steps to the temple felt very intensive, and I will admit that half way up I told Alex I physically could not make it to the top, but then we were passed by two 60 year olds that said ‘shame on the both of you’ and then a mother literally carrying her 3 year old on her back. I piped down then and dragged my sorry ass to the top. </p>
							
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Tiger Steps.jpg">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Tiger Budda.jpg" style="margin-top: 12vh; margin-bottom: 16vh">
							<p class="diary-entries">The view was incredible, the south was completely flat and to the north were huge limestone cliffs and forests. It was worth the climb. A monkey tried to steal Alex’s water bottle again! I'm not worried about Alex giving it up though, he’s taking no prisoners. </p>
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Tiger View.jpg" style="margin-top: 21vh; margin-bottom: 26vh">
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Krabi\Erin View.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Then we went on an hour-long ride to visit the emerald pool. I might have enjoyed the journey more than the destination, it was so relaxing sitting on the back holding onto Alex and just watching the scenery go past. The pool was still very fun, couldn’t really get a picture and it was quite busy but freshwater always feels nicer than sea water, and it was in fact very emerald in colour. </p>

							</figure>
							<p class="diary-entries">I think the real highlight of the day for us both was going to the hot spring waterfall. I read afterwards that the water temperature is between 40 to 50 (DEGREES). It was so toasty warm, with several natural pools to swim and bob about in. It was very cool, although I thought Alex was dead at one point, he was floating face down holding his breath for an uncomfortable amount of time.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">On the subject of things nearly being dead, Alex spooked a dog going past on the scooter and nearly ran it over. Anyway! live laugh love, look at the delicious food I ate for dinner.</p>

							<p class="diary-entries">Not too much to say about today. We checked out at 11 and said goodbye to Krabi, which I think has been my favourite place on the trip so far. The bus to Phuket was only 3.5 hours on a relatively comfortable coach, however Alex was sat on a very determined recliner seat that would not stay upright despite his best efforts. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Only left the airbnb to get dinner. Another good meal, I think we’re back on a winning streak in that department. Hoping to sleep off the tiredness in my legs from the Temple yesterday and start tomorrow bright and early ready to explore Phuket old town. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="17">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 29-01-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">There is nothing to say about today. Alex spends an increasing amount of time with his hands down his pants. I suppose tonight we will continue to watch knives out for the third night as Alex refuses to take the hint that I'm not enjoying the film. </P>
							<p class="diary-entries">Sorry, for reals.</P>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Street Drinks.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We have both shamelessly had a very lazy day. Think I slept more than 14 hours last night and today. We didn’t leave the room until 6pm and I think that was only because hunger was getting harder to ignore. We aimed to visit the Sunday walking street market but for some reason all the streets around Old town were bustling with stalls and people, they even had wardens blocking the roads to cars. It was just too busy, you couldn’t possibly stand to browse the clothes or pick out snacks. We did buy a drink and I took a few quick pictures but we headed out of the busy streets as soon as we could. Eventually we found a little ramen restaurant, the food was delicious, but then after not eating all day anything might have tasted good. The fried prawns I know for sure were exceptional, we ordered them twice. </P>

							<p class="diary-entries">Spent today much like yesterday, I don't know why going out to explore Phuket doesn't really appeal.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">We did go out for food which again was really good, when we walked past a second time there was a queue waiting outside so must be highly rated. Then we walked to a huge stationary store, which is not quite the cultural experience we should be seeking out but it was a lot of fun. We also saw the Thailand equivalent to a lolly pop man! Much cooler, he helped us cross with a bunch of school kids.</P>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Erin with Drink.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex realised he accidentally left us without a night anywhere when he booked our next airbnb stay for the 1st of Feb and extended our stay here by only one night, there are 31 days in January. Being so last minute we've had to book another night here! 4 nights in a place we were only supposed to stay 2. Bored tirelessly and just want to move on but Alex cheered me up some by taking us to the Thailand McDonald's!</P>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Alex Burger.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We tried the Samurai Burger and cheese sticks which were exactly what we needed and the fries were super hot and crunchy. I made the mistake of getting the Pineapple pie to try which was disgusting, but proof that Alex will really eat anything, he gobbled that up too. He is however complaining of a sore jaw now as he has forgotten what chewing food feels like after so much rice and bite sized pieces of meat.</P>

							<p class="diary-entries">Another similar day. No plans. Alex loves his puzzle book a little too much and has been consumed.</P>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Phuket\Puzzle Book.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We went out specifically for dessert and tried Patongo, which didn't look too appetizing but tasted very much like a donut. Very funny that it came with scissors, dedicated to their banishment of knives. Alex especially enjoyed the drizzle on top, the pervert. </P>

							</figure>
							<p class="diary-entries">We'd planned to stay out a little longer but Alex had an 'embarrassing' encounter and being absolutely mortified made us go back to the airbnb. It wasn't such a big deal, but Alex brushed off a guy in the street who had said 'can I ask you a question?' The guy chuckled after Alex said no and we walked past, then we heard him ask someone else and realized he just wanted someone to take a picture for him. Alex felt awful. It was funny at first but following a night of self pity I couldn't laugh.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">Coming to accept there is no internet in this black hole. Music plays loudly from the hotel next door, but that's better than the previous night where fireworks were set off every 20 minutes.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">A late addition to the entry! There is a cockroach in the room! Saw it pacing across the room when we were playing cards. I was surprised that Alex was scared of it, he had his torch out to check where it had disappeared off to and was very preoccupied. He said 'of course I'm scared it's creepy'. It is rather big and admittedly creepy. The situation escalated when we tried to gently coax it onto the balcony and the result was Alex stood on a stool in the bathroom. Sadly I didn't get a picture.</P>

							<p class="diary-entries">Today brought around a real highlight to the trip. </P>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got a bus to the pier and then a speedboat to Koh Yao Noi. Trekked for far too long with our bags to a scooter rental place, the lovely woman gave us a discount for hiring a scooter for 5 days and helped us ride our bags to the airbnb because despite our best efforts we couldn't balance 2 people and 6 bags onto the scooter.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">We checked in to a cute cabin and said hello to both our neighbours (there's no WiFi in the room so updates will be slow again) then we ran the scooter just 5 minutes down the road to the closest beach, got there just in time to watch the sunset with not a single other person in sight. </P>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Noi\First Night Sunset.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We waded out into the water which even at high tide is barely waist deep, but it was incredibly calm. There we were just floating on our backs comfortably when I noticed a faint blue glow in the splash from moving my arm. I thought I'd imagined it! Bioluminescent plankton!! It was so unexpected, once we noticed it seemed to be everywhere. It was so incredibly magical, it rose up and scattered with every movement, rolling over our skin like dancing fairies of electric blue light. We took turns drawing attention to each other like children 'look at me!' Then performing elaborate waves and dances to draw up the most light and then giggling in wonder. I have no idea how long we spent out there in the dark, I think it's one of my favourite memories ever.</P>
							<p class="diary-entries">Finished the night sat at the restaurant attached to the airbnb which the owner kindly kept open for us, and once he had closed up the kitchen he brought us a light so we could stay here whilst Alex catches up uploading the entries from the past few days. </P>

							<p class="diary-entries">Woke up really early to catch the sunrise on the beach and then took a morning swim. I saw a few fish with my snorkel goggles on but nothing amazing, it was quite rocky and murky.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Noi\Sunrise.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">After a regrettable nap which had us both waking up drenched in sweat inside our cabin that had become a hot box, we decided to take a dip in the swimming pool. Alex painstakingly tried to teach me a proper breaststroke, but he gave up and went back to his puzzle book and I have made no progress. Alex thinks secretly progress was made but I just don't know about it.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">After 3 weeks and gradual complacency with suncream we are both sunburnt. Alex is more burnt than me and has already made me moisturise his back twice. We will be more careful going forward.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent a few hours riding around the island on the scooter, we'll explore the North of the island tomorrow. Alex let me drive the scooter to the beach in the morning but he has absolutely no trust in me and wouldn't stop panicking so now I have resigned to sitting on the back again. I don't mind too much though because I get to look around more.</p>

							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Noi\Be Real.jpeg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Alex caught a fly in mid air. It was impressive, but was not thorough enough because I have been massacred in the night by mosquitos. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 03-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">'We'll explore the North of the island tomorrow' a fateful decision that might have become a key piece of evidence in a missing person investigation. Exploring the North became a disastrous adventure that eventually led us to a birthday party.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We rode on Scoopy (in hindsight we shouldn't have given the bike a pet name) down a winding road that snakes through the centre of the island. Unbeknownst to us using Google for directions, the road does not maintain itself as a usable road for very long and becomes a dirt path, then a rocky trail. Scoopy served us well but he struggled on the constant uphills. Eventually we had to accept that the trail is now completely inaccessible by bike, but Google promised we were close to the North most bay that we had been heading towards. We walked for 20 minutes through the jungle with a cliff edge to the right. In my happy oblivion I tend to not pay any attention to time or circumstance but Alex began to panic about it going dark and felt threatened by the sound of monkeys. We pushed on and found Mankei Bay which looked particularly beautiful under the bright moon, but then we had a raging argument which lasted the entire walk back to Scoopy, in admittedly the pitch black. Then we had to ride Scoopy down the rocky trail which was difficult in daylight and near impossible in the dark but you can trust Alex to not take any risks and ride slow. Very slow. Not that it made any difference because half way through the back tire went flat and we were stranded. No street lights, no houses, and no phone signal. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Noi\Mankei Moon.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">We pushed Scoopy and Alex showed a glimmer of hope as he remembered the woman we hired the scooters from gave us her card to WhatsApp her if we were in any trouble. Funny thing is I knew that I had already squirreled the card away into my 'memory pouch' along with all the other cards, tickets and receipts I've collected, kept safe in my backpack, back at the airbnb. Alex didn't find it particularly funny. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Close to the beginning of the 'road' part a few people went past on scooters without stopping to help and in our crippling shyness we weren't about to call out but then, from the distance we heard 'Sawadee Ka' A little old women, our saviour, emerged from a house and through elaborate explanations with our hands we told her about the flat tire. She went next door to get her daughter, who called our airbnb for us. Our host then sent her grandson to pick us up, who arrived only 10 minutes later riding a beaten up scooter with a metal cage attached for us to sit in. Off we rode almost smoothly into the distance. Our driver had to shimmy a leg out and help push us up the hills, but we made it back to our place.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Noi\Sidecar.jpg">
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Noi\Abandoned Scoopy.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Our host and his family were stood smiling in the restaurant waiting for us. <br>'Are you okay?' <br>'Yes'<br>'Is the bike okay?' <br>A sad shake of our heads, we had to abandon Scoopy outside the house.<br>'Have you eaten?' <br>And that's how we ended up being invited into a family birthday party. The food was delicious, and we got a slice of coconut sponge cake and orange sponge cake along with passionfruit soda. Well looked after.</p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 04-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">A replacement for Scoopy came this morning, this scooter is blue and just isn't giving the same energy.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We had an easy day enjoying the sun, I tried in vain to even out some of my tan lines by the pool and then we went to the beach and played Frisbee thanks to Andrea (and Alex's determination to pack it). Then Alex went on a spontaneous jog around the beach and returned with a dramatic story about 1000's of crabs.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to pick up our bug spray that we had left in Scoopy from the women and when we arrived she smiled and pointed at Scoopy by the side of the road in a way to suggest 'good news the tire’s fixed' but Alex just looked over and said 'oh, there he is' which made me feel really sad. I think we need to socialise with other people more because we have both gotten tragically attached to the only other thing besides each other that has been around more than 3 days.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">On the subject of socialising, Alex made friends with a screaming child in the restaurant that we went to in the evening. He got her told off for being too loud and excited, which is no different to back home with Theo. He's such a bad influence. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Koh Yao Noi has been the first place that we've stayed at for 4 nights and haven't wanted to leave sooner. Really excited to see how Koh Yao Yai compares.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="24">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="koh-yao-yai"> 05-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Breakfast was slightly disappointing, we both specifically ordered 'pancakes with banana inside and on top' and what arrived were pancakes with only banana on top. It’s just not on, but no time to sulk because we had a long tail boat with our names on it... or rather the name of our next island Koh Yao Yai! A very quick 10 minute island hop.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Our host made a real effort and met us at the pier with a scooter ready and taxi ordered to help us with our bags and our home for the next 3 nights is perfect! It's a farmstead but I've only seen a few chickens mulling about nearby. There's only two properties, ours and the neighbouring one with a Russian guy staying, it’s private and cosy. Alex said the walkways make it feel like the Maldives but without the water, which makes it sound a bit naff but ignore him, it's really nice.</p>
							<img class="duel-image-2" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Yai\Alex Following.jpg">
							<img class="duel-image-1" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Yai\Farmstead.jpg" style="margin-top: 13vh; marign-bottom: 14vh;">
							<p class="diary-entries">We've rode down the entirety of the main road already, it doesn't feel like there's much more to explore which is baffling considering how much larger this island is compared to Noi but it feels so empty! I have no idea where the 1,000s of supposed residents live. The full extent of the town appears to be a 7/11 and 5 food vendors, it does feel like a quiet retreat. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We went to a beach covered in glorious fine white sand. The tide was out so we couldn't experience the beauty in full but plenty of time to return. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Yai\Erin Beach.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">I've realised that I have started to drink Thai tea as a replacement to my regular cups of tea at home, but I'll have to put a stop to it soon before I turn the same bright orange colour, it cannot be good for me and there's enough sugar in it to hold my straw up, almost. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We met a particularly earnest burger man that asked us after our meal if he could have done anything better, even though he gets a 5 star google review for just having mayonnaise and ketchup! </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Fyi there's no WiFi at our place so updates will be slow.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="25">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="feb-week1"> 06-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Gone out specifically to poach WiFi so we can update the website and download more from Netflix, but otherwise I think we would have stayed sitting on our porch playing windows for hours and completely forgotten to eat again. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Now with a full belly and only a slightly distracting reggae cover of 'country roads' playing from a radio, I’m free to write. </p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Yai\Cafe View.jpeg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Life feels good today, in the course of 24hrs me and Alex have enacted a typical story plot with rising tensions amounting in a major climax of emotional fallout at around 3am (it was very dramatic) but now we've made it to the turning point in our story where we come to many resolutions and can sit happily sipping coke and enjoying the sun together.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We've had a great morning, high tide was later today at 11am so we were at the beach with the white sand with plenty of time to enjoy it. We played more with the Frisbee and I tried out my new and improved breaststroke technique which I do believe I've made progress in. Alex has finally started to share his puzzle book with me so I was able to sit quizzically for a while with him and now my head feels as clear as the sky. We will frazzle in this sun for sure.</p>
							<img class="lone-image" src="images\Diary Images\Koh Yao Yai\White Beach.jpg">
							<p class="diary-entries">Set up a tournament for our games and it’s gotten serious pretty quickly. I've been on a real lucky streak with rummikub, we're tied at hanamikoji and Alex has taken the edge on windows.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="26">
							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 07-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Another day doing sweet nothing, we’ve lazed around at the beach having conversations in the sand and playing frisbee. </p>
							<figure>

								<figcaption>An almost perfect picture… If Alex could have moved the seaweed.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p class="diary-entries">There appears to be a disproportionate amount of children living on the island compared to adults. The school looks big but it's not just that, there’s children ferrying each other around on scooters and nearly every scooter that does have an adult on, has a child crammed in somewhere! My conspiracy is that the island really belongs to children and they just employ a few adults to stand at food venders as a front. However, if the crabs decided to stage a coup they’d have the numbers. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Would have liked to do some night swimming at the beach like on Noi but the thought of millions of crabs all coming out of their tiny holes in the sand is enough to stop me. We finally saw a full sized crab today, they camouflage so well but I think Alex has temporarily traded in plane spotting for crab spotting, he likes chasing them until they throw themselves into the sea. The assurance that ‘they’re more scared of you’ is not enough to make me join in with any amount of commitment. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We spent hours riding across the entire island in the search for pancakes, the two places we found from google were closed. It was a fruitless effort and we once again settled for rice and noodles. Alex was appalled by the portion size more than usual. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">Oh! Big news, I have gained enough confidence, and Alex has gained enough trust in me, that I have become a respected and skilled second driver on the scooter! As long as I wear my glasses we can take turns to ride first. It’s great fun but Alex still pulls a face having to sit at the back because it's less comfortable and I maybe can’t always see bumps in the road that I need to slow down for until we’ve hit them. </p>

							<h2 class="diary-dates"> 08-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Happi in Krabi! It’s just for one night whilst we wait to get our bus in the morning up to Koh Samui but a great opportunity for us to revisit our favorite restaurant here and stock up on more banana bread from the night market! We also tried the softest fluffiest sponge cake ever, shame we only got one to share, it was 90% air and barely left an aftertaste. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We’ve done a bit of research on where to go after Koh Samui, decided to skip out Koh PhaNgan to spend more time in Koh Tao, hopefully find some clear water and fishes to spy on. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We cheaped out on the room for tonight and as a consequence our AC unit is broken. I think at this point it's actually blowing out warmer air than outside. Feels like it’s going to be a really long night. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="28">
							<h2 class="diary-dates" id="koh-samui"> 09-02-23</h2>
							<p class="diary-entries">Wish I had more to say on our first impressions of Koh Samui but the coach and ferry ended up taking 6 hrs 30 and left us both feeling knackered. We couldn’t sleep on the coach because the driver was acting like he was on a scooter and treated the accelerator like an on/ off button so we were never at a smooth constant speed but were jerked around for the entire drive.</p>
							<p class="diary-entries">From the ferry we caught a bus and had our backpacks thrown onto the roof, then the heavens opened with a vengeance and our bags got soaked. Nothing inside my bag got wet, but Alex was not so lucky. Worst of all, the soap for our clothes, that we had started to use very conservatively to make last, has leaked all over his toiletry bag. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We’ve landed ourselves in yet another lovely airbnb with a wonderfully friendly host. I smacked my shin on the metal footboard of our bed, I even made a big deal over warning Alex about it because it’s hidden under the bedsheets. Not even 30 minutes later I throw myself down onto the bed in a dramatic display of exhaustion and nearly knock myself out. I hit my temple not even a cm away from my eye on the same damn bedframe I specifically made a point over! I’m not too sure where the tears came from but I cried a lot. Alex after his initial slew of abuse calling me an idiot and telling me off for ‘floundering around’ did comfort me but it was too late and I could only ride out the self pity in full. </p>
							<p class="diary-entries">We got food, I took this picture of the street and sky which I thought looked moody and foreboding. I hope tomorrow is better weather, and that I don't wake up with a black eye.</p>
